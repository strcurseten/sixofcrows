<h3 style="text-align:center">Inej</h3>
<b>Kaz Brekker didn’t need a reason.</b> Those were the words whispered on the
streets of Ketterdam, in the taverns and coffeehouses, in the dark and
bleeding alleys of the pleasure district known as the Barrel. The boy they
called Dirtyhands didn’t need a reason any more than he needed permission
—to break a leg, sever an alliance, or change a man’s fortunes with the turn
of a card.
    Of course they were wrong, Inej considered as she crossed the bridge
over the black waters of the Beurskanal to the deserted main square that
fronted the Exchange. Every act of violence was deliberate, and every favor
came with enough strings attached to stage a puppet show. Kaz always had
his reasons. Inej could just never be sure they were good ones. Especially
tonight.
    Inej checked her knives, silently reciting their names as she always did
when she thought there might be trouble. It was a practical habit, but a
comfort, too. The blades were her companions. She liked knowing they
were ready for whatever the night might bring.
She saw Kaz and the others gathered near the great stone arch that
marked the eastern entrance to the Exchange. Three words had been carved
into the rock above them: Enjent, Voorhent, Almhent. Industry, Integrity,
Prosperity.
    She kept close to the shuttered storefronts that lined the square, avoiding
the pockets of flickering gaslight cast by the streetlamps. As she moved, she
inventoried the crew Kaz had brought with him: Dirix, Rotty, Muzzen and
Keeg, Anika and Pim, and his chosen seconds for tonight’s parley, Jesper
and Big Bolliger. They jostled and bumped one another, laughing, stamping
their feet against the cold snap that had surprised the city this week, the last
gasp of winter before spring began in earnest. They were all bruisers and
brawlers, culled from the younger members of the Dregs, the people Kaz
trusted most. Inej noted the glint of knives tucked into their belts, lead
pipes, weighted chains, axe handles studded with rusty nails, and here and
there, the oily gleam of a gun barrel. She slipped silently into their ranks,
scanning the shadows near the Exchange for signs of Black Tip spies.
    “Three ships!” Jesper was saying. “The Shu sent them. They were just
sitting in First Harbor, cannons out, red flags flying, stuffed to the sails with
gold.”
    Big Bolliger gave a low whistle. “Would have liked to see that.”
“Would have liked to steal that,” replied Jesper. “Half the Merchant
Council was down there flapping and squawking, trying to figure out what
to do.”
    “Don’t they want the Shu paying their debts?” Big Bolliger asked.
    Kaz shook his head, dark hair glinting in the lamplight. He was a
collection of hard lines and tailored edges—sharp jaw, lean build, wool coat
snug across his shoulders. “Yes and no,” he said in his rock salt rasp. “It’s
always good to have a country in debt to you. Makes for friendlier
negotiations.”
“Maybe the Shu are done being friendly,” said Jesper. “They didn’t have
to send all that treasure at once. You think they stuck that trade
ambassador?”
Kaz’s eyes found Inej unerringly in the crowd. Ketterdam had been
buzzing about the assassination of the ambassador for weeks. It had nearly
destroyed Kerch-Zemeni relations and sent the Merchant Council into an
uproar. The Zemeni blamed the Kerch. The Kerch suspected the Shu. Kaz
didn’t care who was responsible; the murder fascinated him because he
couldn’t figure out how it had been accomplished. In one of the busiest
corridors of the Stadhall, in full view of more than a dozen government
officials, the Zemeni trade ambassador had stepped into a washroom. No
one else had entered or left, but when his aide knocked on the door a few
minutes later, there had been no answer. When they’d broken down the
door, they’d found the ambassador facedown on the white tiles, a knife in
his back, the sink still running.
Kaz had sent Inej to investigate the premises after hours. The washroom
had no other entrance, no windows or vents, and even Inej hadn’t mastered
the art of squeezing herself through the plumbing. Yet the Zemeni
ambassador was dead. Kaz hated a puzzle he couldn’t solve, and he and Inej
had concocted a hundred theories to account for the murder—none of which
satisfied. But they had more pressing problems tonight.
She saw him signal to Jesper and Big Bolliger to divest themselves of
weapons. Street law dictated that for a parley of this kind each lieutenant be
seconded by two of his foot soldiers and that they all be unarmed. Parley.
The word felt like a deception—strangely prim, an antique. No matter what
street law decreed, this night smelled like violence.
“Go on, give those guns over,” Dirix said to Jesper.
With a great sigh, Jesper removed the gun belts at his hips. She had to
admit he looked less himself without them. The Zemeni sharpshooter was
long-limbed, brown-skinned, constantly in motion. He pressed his lips to
the pearl handles of his prized revolvers, bestowing each with a mournful
kiss.
“Take good care of my babies,” Jesper said as he handed them over to
Dirix. “If I see a single scratch or nick on those, I’ll spell forgive me on
your chest in bullet holes.”
“You wouldn’t waste the ammo.”
“And he’d be dead halfway through forgive,” Big Bolliger said as he
dropped a hatchet, a switchblade, and his preferred weapon—a thick chain
weighted with a heavy padlock—into Rotty’s expectant hands.
Jesper rolled his eyes. “It’s about sending a message. What’s the point of
a dead guy with forg written on his chest?”
“Compromise,” Kaz said. “I’m sorry does the trick and uses fewer
bullets.”
Dirix laughed, but Inej noted that he cradled Jesper’s revolvers very
gently.
“What about that?” Jesper asked, gesturing to Kaz’s walking stick.
Kaz’s laugh was low and humorless. “Who’d deny a poor cripple his
cane?”
“If the cripple is you, then any man with sense.”
“Then it’s a good thing we’re meeting Geels.” Kaz drew a watch from
his vest pocket. “It’s almost midnight.”
Inej turned her gaze to the Exchange. It was little more than a large
rectangular courtyard surrounded by warehouses and shipping offices. But
during the day, it was the heart of Ketterdam, bustling with wealthy
merchers buying and selling shares in the trade voyages that passed through
the city’s ports. Now it was nearly twelve bells, and the Exchange was
deserted but for the guards who patrolled the perimeter and the rooftop.
They’d been bribed to look the other way during tonight’s parley.
The Exchange was one of the few remaining parts of the city that hadn’t
been divvied up and claimed in the ceaseless skirmishes between
Ketterdam’s rival gangs. It was supposed to be neutral territory. But it didn’t
feel neutral to Inej. It felt like the hush of the woods before the snare yanks
tight and the rabbit starts to scream. It felt like a trap.
“This is a mistake,” she said. Big Bolliger startled; he hadn’t known she
was standing there. Inej heard the name the Dregs preferred for her
whispered among their ranks—the Wraith. “Geels is up to something.”
“Of course he is,” said Kaz. His voice had the rough, abraded texture of
stone against stone. Inej always wondered if he’d sounded that way as a
little boy. If he’d ever been a little boy.
“Then why come here tonight?”
“Because this is the way Per Haskell wants it.”
Old man, old ways, Inej thought but didn’t say, and she suspected the
other Dregs were thinking the same thing.
“He’s going to get us all killed,” she said.
Jesper stretched his long arms overhead and grinned, his teeth white
against his dark skin. He had yet to give up his rifle, and the silhouette of it
across his back made him resemble a gawky, long-limbed bird.
“Statistically, he’ll probably only get some of us killed.”
“It’s not something to joke about,” she replied. The look Kaz cast her
was amused. She knew how she sounded—stern, fussy, like an old crone
making dire pronouncements from her porch. She didn’t like it, but she also
knew she was right. Besides, old women must know something, or they
wouldn’t live to gather wrinkles and yell from their front stoops.
“Jesper isn’t making a joke, Inej,” said Kaz. “He’s figuring the odds.”
Big Bolliger cracked his huge knuckles. “Well, I’ve got lager and a
skillet of eggs waiting for me at the Kooperom, so I can’t be the one to die
tonight.”
“Care to place a wager?” Jesper asked.
“I’m not going to bet on my own death.”
Kaz flipped his hat onto his head and ran his gloved fingers along the
brim in a quick salute. “Why not, Bolliger? We do it every day.”
He was right. Inej’s debt to Per Haskell meant she gambled her life
every time she took on a new job or assignment, every time she left her
room at the Slat. Tonight was no different.
Kaz struck his walking stick against the cobblestones as the bells from
the Church of Barter began to chime. The group fell silent. The time for talk
was done. “Geels isn’t smart, but he’s just bright enough to be trouble,” said
Kaz. “No matter what you hear, you don’t join the fray unless I give the
command. Stay sharp.” Then he gave Inej a brief nod. “And stay hidden.”
“No mourners,” Jesper said as he tossed his rifle to Rotty.
“No funerals,” the rest of the Dregs murmured in reply. Among them, it
passed for “good luck.”
Before Inej could melt into the shadows, Kaz tapped her arm with his
crow’s head cane. “Keep a watch on the rooftop guards. Geels may have
them in his pocket.”
“Then—” Inej began, but Kaz was already gone.
Inej threw up her hands in frustration. She had a hundred questions, but
as usual, Kaz was keeping a stranglehold on the answers.
She jogged toward the canal-facing wall of the Exchange. Only the
lieutenants and their seconds were allowed to enter during the parley. But
just in case the Black Tips got any ideas, the other Dregs would be waiting
right outside the eastern arch with weapons at the ready. She knew Geels
would have his crew of heavily armed Black Tips gathered at the western
entrance.
Inej would find her own way in. The rules of fair play among the gangs
were from Per Haskell’s time. Besides, she was the Wraith—the only law
that applied to her was gravity, and some days she defied that, too.
The lower level of the Exchange was dedicated to windowless
warehouses, so Inej located a drainpipe to shinny up. Something made her
hesitate before she wrapped her hand around it. She drew a bonelight from
her pocket and gave it a shake, casting a pale green glow over the pipe. It
was slick with oil. She followed the wall, seeking another option, and found
a stone cornice bearing a statue of Kerch’s three flying fishes within reach.
She stood on her toes and tentatively felt along the top of the cornice. It had
been covered in ground glass. I am expected, she thought with grim
pleasure.
She’d joined up with the Dregs less than two years ago, just days after
her fifteenth birthday. It had been a matter of survival, but it gratified her to
know that, in such short time, she’d become someone to take precautions
against. Though, if the Black Tips thought tricks like this would keep the
Wraith from her goal, they were sadly mistaken.
She drew two climbing spikes from the pockets of her quilted vest and
wedged first one then the other between the bricks of the wall as she hoisted
herself higher, her questing feet finding the smallest holds and ridges in the
stone. As a child learning the high wire, she’d gone barefoot. But the streets
of Ketterdam were too cold and wet for that. After a few bad spills, she’d
paid a Grisha Fabrikator working in secret out of a gin shop on the
Wijnstraat to make her a pair of leather slippers with nubbly rubber soles.
They were perfectly fitted to her feet and gripped any surface with surety.
On the second story of the Exchange, she hoisted herself onto a window
ledge just wide enough to perch on.
Kaz had done his best to teach her, but she didn’t quite have his way
with breaking and entering, and it took her a few tries to finesse the lock.
Finally she heard a satisfying click, and the window swung open on a
deserted office, its walls covered in maps marked with trade routes and
chalkboards listing share prices and the names of ships. She ducked inside,
refastened the latch, and picked her way past the empty desks with their
neat stacks of orders and tallies.
She crossed to a slender set of doors and stepped onto a balcony that
overlooked the central courtyard of the Exchange. Each of the shipping
offices had one. From here, callers announced new voyages and arrivals of
inventory, or hung the black flag that indicated that a ship had been lost at
sea with all its cargo. The floor of the Exchange would erupt into a flurry of
trades, runners would spread the word throughout the city, and the price of
goods, futures, and shares in outgoing voyages would rise or fall. But
tonight all was silence.
A wind came in off the harbor, bringing the smell of the sea, ruffling the
stray hairs that had escaped the braided coil at the nape of Inej’s neck.
Down in the square, she saw the sway of lamplight and heard the thump of
Kaz’s cane on the stones as he and his seconds made their way across the
square. On the opposite side, she glimpsed another set of lanterns heading
toward them. The Black Tips had arrived.
Inej raised her hood. She pulled herself onto the railing and leapt
soundlessly to the neighboring balcony, then the next, tracking Kaz and the
others around the square, staying as close as she could. His dark coat
rippled in the salt breeze, his limp more pronounced tonight, as it always
was when the weather turned cold. She could hear Jesper keeping up a
lively stream of conversation, and Big Bolliger’s low, rumbling chuckle.
As she drew nearer to the other side of the square, Inej saw that Geels
had chosen to bring Elzinger and Oomen—exactly as she had predicted.
Inej knew the strengths and weaknesses of every member of the Black Tips,
not to mention Harley’s Pointers, the Liddies, the Razorgulls, the Dime
Lions, and every other gang working the streets of Ketterdam. It was her
job to know that Geels trusted Elzinger because they’d come up through the
ranks of the Black Tips together, and because Elzinger was built like a stack
of boulders—nearly seven feet tall, dense with muscle, his wide, mashed-in
face jammed low on a neck thick as a pylon.
She was suddenly glad Big Bolliger was with Kaz. That Kaz had chosen
Jesper to be one of his seconds was no surprise. Twitchy as Jesper was, with
or without his revolvers, he was at his best in a fight, and she knew he’d do
anything for Kaz. She’d been less sure when Kaz had insisted on Big
Bolliger as well. Big Bol was a bouncer at the Crow Club, perfectly suited
to tossing out drunks and wasters, but too heavy on his feet to be much use
when it came to a real tussle. Still, at least he was tall enough to look
Elzinger in the eye.
Inej didn’t want to think too much on Geels’ other second. Oomen made
her nervous. He wasn’t as physically intimidating as Elzinger. In fact,
Oomen was made like a scarecrow—not scrawny, but as if beneath his
clothes, his body had been put together at wrong angles. Word was he’d
once crushed a man’s skull with his bare hands, wiped his palms clean on
his shirtfront, and kept right on drinking.
Inej tried to quiet the unease roiling through her, and listened as Geels
and Kaz made small talk in the square while their seconds patted each of
them down to make sure no one was carrying.
“Naughty,” Jesper said as he removed a tiny knife from Elzinger’s
sleeve and tossed it across the square.
“Clear,” declared Big Bolliger as he finished patting down Geels and
moved on to Oomen.
Kaz and Geels discussed the weather, the suspicion that the Kooperom
was serving watered-down drinks now that the rent had been raised—
dancing around the real reason they’d come here tonight. In theory, they
would chat, make their apologies, agree to respect the boundaries of Fifth
Harbor, then all head out to find a drink together—at least that’s what Per
Haskell had insisted.
But what does Per Haskell know? Inej thought as she looked for the
guards patrolling the roof above, trying to pick out their shapes in the dark.
Haskell ran the Dregs, but these days, he preferred to sit in the warmth of
his room, drinking lukewarm lager, building model ships, and telling long
stories of his exploits to anyone who would listen. He seemed to think
territory wars could be settled as they once had been: with a short scuffle
and a friendly handshake. But every one of Inej’s senses told her that was
not how this was going to play out. Her father would have said the shadows
were about their own business tonight. Something bad was going to happen
here.
Kaz stood with both gloved hands resting on the carved crow’s head of
his cane. He looked totally at ease, his narrow face obscured by the brim of
his hat. Most gang members in the Barrel loved flash: gaudy waistcoats,
watch fobs studded with false gems, trousers in every print and pattern
imaginable. Kaz was the exception—the picture of restraint, his dark vests
and trousers simply cut and tailored along severe lines. At first, she’d
thought it was a matter of taste, but she’d come to understand that it was a
joke he played on the upstanding merchers. He enjoyed looking like one of
them.
“I’m a businessman,” he’d told her. “No more, no less.”
“You’re a thief, Kaz.”
“Isn’t that what I just said?”
Now he looked like some kind of priest come to preach to a group of
circus performers. A young priest, she thought with another pang of unease.
Kaz had called Geels old and washed up, but he certainly didn’t seem that
way tonight. The Black Tips’ lieutenant might have wrinkles creasing the
corners of his eyes and burgeoning jowls beneath his sideburns, but he
looked confident, experienced. Next to him Kaz looked … well, seventeen.
“Let’s be fair, ja? All we want is a bit more scrub,” Geels said, tapping
the mirrored buttons of his lime-green waistcoat. “It’s not fair for you to
cull every spend-happy tourist stepping off a pleasure boat at Fifth Harbor.”
“Fifth Harbor is ours, Geels,” Kaz replied. “The Dregs get first crack at
the pigeons who come looking for a little fun.”
Geels shook his head. “You’re a young one, Brekker,” he said with an
indulgent laugh. “Maybe you don’t understand how these things work. The
harbors belong to the city, and we have as much right to them as anyone.
We’ve all got a living to make.”
Technically, that was true. But Fifth Harbor had been useless and all but
abandoned by the city when Kaz had taken it over. He’d had it dredged, and
then built out the docks and the quay, and he’d had to mortgage the Crow
Club to do it. Per Haskell had railed at him and called him a fool for the
expense, but eventually he’d relented. According to Kaz, the old man’s
exact words had been, “Take all that rope and hang yourself.” But the
endeavor had paid for itself in less than a year. Now Fifth Harbor offered
berths to mercher ships, as well as boats from all over the world carrying
tourists and soldiers eager to see the sights and sample the pleasures of
Ketterdam. The Dregs got first try at all of them, steering them—and their
wallets—into brothels, taverns, and gambling dens owned by the gang.
Fifth Harbor had made the old man very rich, and cemented the Dregs as
real players in the Barrel in a way that not even the success of the Crow
Club had. But with profit came unwanted attention. Geels and the Black
Tips had been making trouble for the Dregs all year, encroaching on Fifth
Harbor, picking off pigeons that weren’t rightfully theirs.
“Fifth Harbor is ours,” Kaz repeated. “It isn’t up for negotiation. You’re
cutting into our traffic from the docks, and you intercepted a shipment of
jurda that should have docked two nights ago.”
“Don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“I know it comes easy, Geels, but try not to play dumb with me.”
Geels took a step forward. Jesper and Big Bolliger tensed.
“Quit flexing, boy,” Geels said. “We all know the old man doesn’t have
the stomach for a real brawl.”
Kaz’s laugh was dry as the rustle of dead leaves. “But I’m the one at
your table, Geels, and I’m not here for a taste. You want a war, I’ll make
sure you eat your fill.”
“And what if you’re not around, Brekker? Everyone knows you’re the
spine of Haskell’s operation—snap it and the Dregs collapse.”
Jesper snorted. “Stomach, spine. What’s next, spleen?”
“Shut it,” Oomen snarled. The rules of parley dictated that only the
lieutenants could speak once negotiations had begun. Jesper mouthed
“sorry” and elaborately pantomimed locking his lips shut.
“I’m fairly sure you’re threatening me, Geels,” Kaz said. “But I want to
be certain before I decide what to do about it.”
“Sure of yourself, aren’t you, Brekker?”
“Myself and nothing else.”
Geels burst out laughing and elbowed Oomen. “Listen to this cocky
little piece of crap. Brekker, you don’t own these streets. Kids like you are
fleas. A new crop of you turns up every few years to annoy your betters
until a big dog decides to scratch. And let me tell you, I’m about tired of the
itch.” He crossed his arms, pleasure rolling off him in smug waves. “What
if I told you there are two guards with city-issue rifles pointed at you and
your boys right now?”
Inej’s stomach dropped. Was that what Kaz had meant when he said
Geels might have the guards in his pocket?
Kaz glanced up at the roof. “Hiring city guards to do your killing? I’d
say that’s an expensive proposition for a gang like the Black Tips. I’m not
sure I believe your coffers could support it.”
Inej climbed onto the railing and launched herself from the safety of the
balcony, heading for the roof. If they survived the night, she was going to
kill Kaz.
There were always two guards from the stadwatch posted on the roof of
the Exchange. A few kruge from the Dregs and the Black Tips had ensured
they wouldn’t interfere with the parley, a common enough transaction. But
Geels was implying something very different. Had he really managed to
bribe city guards to play sniper for him? If so, the Dregs’ odds of surviving
this night had just dwindled to a knife’s point.
Like most of the buildings in Ketterdam, the Exchange had a sharply
gabled roof to keep off heavy rain, so the guards patrolled the rooftop via a
narrow walkway that overlooked the courtyard. Inej ignored it. It was easier
going but would leave her too exposed. Instead she scaled halfway up the
slick roof tiles and started crawling, her body tilted at a precarious angle,
moving like a spider as she kept one eye on the guards’ walkway and one
ear on the conversation below. Maybe Geels was bluffing. Or maybe two
guards were hunched over the railing right now with Kaz or Jesper or Big
Bolliger in their sights.
“Took some doing,” Geels admitted. “We’re a small operation right now,
and city guards don’t come cheap. But it’ll be worth it for the prize.”
“That being me?”
“That being you.”
“I’m flattered.”
“The Dregs won’t last a week without you.”
“I’d give them a month on sheer momentum.”
The thought rattled noisily around in Inej’s head. If Kaz was gone,
would I stay? Or would I skip out on my debt? Take my chances with Per
Haskell’s enforcers? If she didn’t move faster, she might well find out.
“Smug little slum rat.” Geels laughed. “I can’t wait to wipe that look off
your face.”
“So do it,” Kaz said. Inej risked a look down. His voice had changed, all
humor gone.
“Should I have them put a bullet in your good leg, Brekker?”
Where are the guards? Inej thought, picking up her pace. She raced
across the steep pitch of the gable. The Exchange stretched nearly the
length of a city block. There was too much territory to cover.
“Stop talking, Geels. Tell them to shoot.”
“Kaz—” said Jesper nervously.
“Go on. Find your balls and give the order.”
What game was Kaz playing? Had he expected this? Had he just
assumed Inej would find her way to the guards in time?
She glanced down again. Geels radiated anticipation. He took a deep
breath, puffing out his chest. Inej’s steps faltered, and she had to fight not to
go sliding straight off the edge of the roof. He’s going to do it. I’m going to
watch Kaz die.
“Fire!” Geels shouted.
A gunshot split the air. Big Bolliger let loose a cry and crumpled to the
ground.
“Damn it!” shouted Jesper, dropping to one knee beside Bolliger and
pressing his hand to the bullet wound as the big man moaned. “You
worthless podge!” he yelled at Geels. “You just violated neutral territory.”
“Nothing to say you didn’t shoot first,” Geels replied. “And who’s going
to know? None of you are walking out of here.”
Geels’ voice sounded too high. He was trying to maintain his
composure, but Inej could hear panic pulsing against his words, the startled
wing beat of a frightened bird. Why? Moments before he’d been all bluster.
That was when Inej saw Kaz still hadn’t moved. “You don’t look well,
Geels.”
“I’m just fine,” he said. But he wasn’t. He looked pale and shaky. His
eyes were darting right and left as if searching the shadowed walkway of
the roof.
“Are you?” Kaz asked conversationally. “Things aren’t going quite as
planned, are they?”
“Kaz,” Jesper said. “Bolliger’s bleeding bad—”
“Good,” said Kaz.
“Kaz, he needs a medik!”
Kaz spared the wounded man the barest glance. “What he needs to do is
stop his bellyaching and be glad I didn’t have Holst take him down with a
head shot.”
Even from above, Inej saw Geels flinch.
“That’s the guard’s name, isn’t it?” Kaz asked. “Willem Holst and Bert
Van Daal—the two city guards on duty tonight. The ones you emptied the
Black Tips’ coffers to bribe?”
Geels said nothing.
“Willem Holst,” Kaz said loudly, his voice floating up to the roof, “likes
to gamble almost as much as Jesper does, so your money held a lot of
appeal. But Holst has much bigger problems—let’s call them urges. I won’t
go into detail. A secret’s not like coin. It doesn’t keep its value in the
spending. You’ll just have to trust me when I say this one would turn even
your stomach. Isn’t that right, Holst?”
The response was another gunshot. It struck the cobblestones near
Geels’ feet. Geels released a shocked bleat and sprang back.
This time Inej had a better chance to track the origin of the gunfire. The
shot had come from somewhere near the west side of the building. If Holst
was there, that meant the other guard—Bert Van Daal—would be on the
east side. Had Kaz managed to neutralize him, too? Or was he counting on
her? She sped over the gables.
“Just shoot him, Holst!” Geels bellowed, desperation sawing at his
voice. “Shoot him in the head!”
Kaz snorted in disgust. “Do you really think that secret would die with
me? Go on, Holst,” he called. “Put a bullet in my skull. There will be
messengers sprinting to your wife and your watch captain’s door before I
hit the ground.”
No shot came.
“How?” Geels said bitterly. “How did you even know who would be on
duty tonight? I had to pay through the gills to get that roster. You couldn’t
have outbid me.”
“Let’s say my currency carries more sway.”
“Money is money.”
“I trade in information, Geels, the things men do when they think no one
is looking. Shame holds more value than coin ever can.”
He was grandstanding, Inej saw that, buying her time as she leapt over
the slate shingles.
“Are you worrying about the second guard? Good old Bert Van Daal?”
Kaz asked. “Maybe he’s up there right now, wondering what he should do.
Shoot me? Shoot Holst? Or maybe I got to him, too, and he’s getting ready
to blow a hole in your chest, Geels.” He leaned in as if he and Geels were
sharing a great secret. “Why not give Van Daal the order and find out?”
Geels opened and closed his mouth like a carp, then bellowed, “Van
Daal!”
Just as Van Daal parted his lips to answer, Inej slipped up behind him
and placed a blade to his throat. She’d barely had time to pick out his
shadow and slide down the roof tiles. Saints, Kaz liked to cut it close.
“Shhhh,” she whispered in Van Daal’s ear. She gave him a tiny jab in the
side so that he could feel the point of her second dagger pressed against his
kidney.
“Please,” he moaned. “I—”
“I like it when men beg,” she said. “But this isn’t the time for it.”
Below, she could see Geels’ chest rising and falling with panicked
breaths. “Van Daal!” he shouted again. There was rage on his face when he
turned back to Kaz. “Always one step ahead, aren’t you?”
“Geels, when it comes to you, I’d say I have a running start.”
But Geels just smiled—a tiny smile, tight and satisfied. A victor’s smile,
Inej realized with fresh fear.
“The race isn’t over yet.” Geels reached into his jacket and pulled out a
heavy black pistol.
“Finally,” Kaz said. “The big reveal. Now Jesper can stop keening over
Bolliger like a wet-eyed woman.”
Jesper stared at the gun with stunned, furious eyes. “Bolliger searched
him. He … Oh, Big Bol, you idiot,” he groaned.
Inej couldn’t believe what she was seeing. The guard in her arms
released a tiny squeak. In her anger and surprise, she’d accidentally
tightened her grip. “Relax,” she said, easing her hold. But, all Saints, she
wanted to put a knife through something. Big Bolliger had been the one to
pat down Geels. There was no way he could have missed the pistol. He’d
betrayed them.
Was that why Kaz had insisted on bringing Big Bolliger here tonight—
so he’d have public confirmation that Bolliger had gone over to the Black
Tips? It was certainly why he’d let Holst put a bullet in Bolliger’s gut. But
so what? Now everyone knew Big Bol was a traitor. Kaz still had a gun
pointed at his chest.
Geels smirked. “Kaz Brekker, the great escape artist. How are you going
to wriggle your way out of this one?”
“Going out the same way I came in.” Kaz ignored the pistol, turning his
attention to the big man lying on the ground. “Do you know what your
problem is, Bolliger?” He jabbed at the wound in Big Bol’s stomach with
the tip of his cane. “That wasn’t a rhetorical question. Do you know what
your biggest problem is?”
Bolliger mewled. “Noooo…”
“Give me a guess,” Kaz hissed.
Big Bol said nothing, just released another trembling whimper.
“All right, I’ll tell you. You’re lazy. I know it. Everyone knows it. So I
had to ask myself why my laziest bouncer was getting up early twice a
week to walk two extra miles to Cilla’s Fry for breakfast, especially when
the eggs are so much better at the Kooperom. Big Bol becomes an early
riser, the Black Tips start throwing their weight around Fifth Harbor and
then intercept our biggest shipment of jurda. It wasn’t a tough connection to
make.” He sighed and said to Geels, “This is what happens when stupid
people start making big plans, ja?”
“Doesn’t matter much now, does it?” replied Geels. “This gets ugly, I’m
shooting from close range. Maybe your guards get me or my guys, but no
way you’re going to dodge this bullet.”
Kaz stepped into the barrel of the gun so that it was pressed directly
against his chest. “No way at all, Geels.”
“You think I won’t do it?”
“Oh, I think you’d do it gladly, with a song in your black heart. But you
won’t. Not tonight.”
Geels’ finger twitched on the trigger.
“Kaz,” Jesper said. “This whole ‘shoot me’ thing is starting to concern
me.”
Oomen didn’t bother to object to Jesper mouthing off this time. One
man was down. Neutral territory had been violated. The sharp tang of
gunpowder already hung in the air—and along with it a question, unspoken
in the quiet, as if the Reaper himself awaited the answer: How much blood
will be shed tonight?
In the distance a siren wailed.
“Nineteen Burstraat,” Kaz said.
Geels had been shifting slightly from foot to foot; now he went very
still.
“That’s your girl’s address, isn’t it, Geels?”
Geels swallowed. “Don’t have a girl.”
“Oh yes, you do,” crooned Kaz. “She’s pretty, too. Well, pretty enough
for a fink like you. Seems sweet. You love her, don’t you?” Even from the
rooftop, Inej could see the sheen of sweat on Geels’ waxen face. “Of course
you do. No one that fine should ever have looked twice at Barrel scum like
you, but she’s different. She finds you charming. Sure sign of madness if
you ask me, but love is strange that way. Does she like to rest her pretty
head on your shoulder? Listen to you talk about your day?”
Geels looked at Kaz as if he was finally seeing him for the first time.
The boy he’d been talking to had been cocky, reckless, easily amused, but
not frightening—not really. Now the monster was here, dead-eyed and
unafraid. Kaz Brekker was gone, and Dirtyhands had come to see the rough
work done.
“She lives at Nineteen Burstraat,” Kaz said in his gravelly rasp. “Three
floors up, geraniums in the window boxes. There are two Dregs waiting
outside her door right now, and if I don’t walk out of here whole and feeling
righteous, they will set that place alight from floor to rooftop. It will go up
in seconds, burning from both ends with poor Elise trapped in the middle.
Her blonde hair will catch first. Like the wick of a candle.”
“You’re bluffing,” said Geels, but his pistol hand was trembling.
Kaz lifted his head and inhaled deeply. “Getting late now. You heard the
siren. I smell the harbor on the wind, sea and salt, and maybe—is that
smoke I smell, too?” There was pleasure in his voice.
Oh, Saints, Kaz, Inej thought miserably. What have you done now?
Again, Geels’ finger twitched on the trigger, and Inej tensed.
“I know, Geels. I know,” Kaz said sympathetically. “All that planning
and scheming and bribing for nothing. That’s what you’re thinking right
now. How bad it will feel to walk home knowing what you’ve lost. How
angry your boss is going to be when you show up empty-handed and that
much poorer for it. How satisfying it would be to put a bullet in my heart.
You can do it. Pull the trigger. We can all go down together. They can take
our bodies out to the Reaper’s Barge for burning, like all paupers go. Or
you can take the blow to your pride, go back to Burstraat, lay your head in
your girl’s lap, fall asleep still breathing, and dream of revenge. It’s up to
you, Geels. Do we get to go home tonight?”
Geels searched Kaz’s gaze, and whatever he saw there made his
shoulders sag. Inej was surprised to feel a pang of pity for him. He’d
walked into this place buoyed on bravado, a survivor, a champion of the
Barrel. He’d leave as another victim of Kaz Brekker.
“You’ll get what’s coming to you someday, Brekker.”
“I will,” said Kaz, “if there’s any justice in the world. And we all know
how likely that is.”
Geels let his arm drop. The pistol hung uselessly by his side.
Kaz stepped back, brushing the front of his shirt where the gun barrel
had rested. “Go tell your general to keep the Black Tips out of Fifth Harbor
and that we expect him to make amends for the shipment of jurda we lost,
plus five percent for drawing steel on neutral ground and five percent more
for being such a spectacular bunch of asses.”
Then Kaz’s cane swung in a sudden sharp arc. Geels screamed as his
wrist bones shattered. The gun clattered to the paving stones.
“I stood down!” cried Geels, cradling his hand. “I stood down!”
“You draw on me again, I’ll break both your wrists, and you’ll have to
hire someone to help you take a piss.” Kaz tipped the brim of his hat up
with the head of his cane. “Or maybe you can get the lovely Elise to do it
for you.”
Kaz crouched down beside Bolliger. The big man whimpered. “Look at
me, Bolliger. Assuming you don’t bleed to death tonight, you have until
sunset tomorrow to get out of Ketterdam. I hear you’re anywhere near the
city limits, and they’ll find you stuffed in a keg at Cilla’s Fry.” Then he
looked at Geels. “You help Bolliger, or I find out he’s running with the
Black Tips, don’t think I won’t come after you.”
“Please, Kaz,” moaned Bolliger.
“You had a home, and you put a wrecking ball through the front door,
Bolliger. Don’t look for sympathy from me.” He rose and checked his
pocket watch. “I didn’t expect this to go on so long. I’d best be on my way
or poor Elise will be getting a trifle warm.”
Geels shook his head. “There’s something wrong with you, Brekker. I
don’t know what you are, but you’re not made right.”
Kaz cocked his head to one side. “You’re from the suburbs, aren’t you,
Geels? Came to the city to try your luck?” He smoothed his lapel with one
gloved hand. “Well, I’m the kind of bastard they only manufacture in the
Barrel.”
Despite the loaded gun at the Black Tips’ feet, Kaz turned his back on
them and limped across the cobblestones toward the eastern arch. Jesper
squatted down next to Bolliger and gave him a gentle pat on the cheek.
“Idiot,” he said sadly, and followed Kaz out of the Exchange.
From the roof, Inej continued to watch as Oomen picked up and
holstered Geels’ gun and the Black Tips said a few quiet words to each
other.
“Don’t leave,” Big Bolliger begged. “Don’t leave me.” He tried to cling
to the cuff of Geels’ trousers.
Geels shook him off. They left him curled on his side, leaking blood
onto the cobblestones.
Inej plucked Van Daal’s rifle from his hands before she released him.
“Go home,” she told the guard.
He cast a single terrified glance over his shoulder and sprinted off down
the walkway. Far below, Big Bol had started trying to drag himself across
the floor of the Exchange. He might be stupid enough to cross Kaz Brekker,
but he’d survived this long in the Barrel, and that took will. He might make
it.
Help him, a voice inside her said. Until a few moments ago, he’d been
her brother in arms. It seemed wrong to leave him alone. She could go to
him, offer to put him out of his misery quickly, hold his hand as he passed.
She could fetch a medik to save him.
Instead, she spoke a quick prayer in the language of her Saints and
began the steep climb down the outer wall. Inej pitied the boy who might
die alone with no one to comfort him in his last hours or who might live and
spend his life as an exile. But the night’s work wasn’t yet over, and the
Wraith didn’t have time for traitors
