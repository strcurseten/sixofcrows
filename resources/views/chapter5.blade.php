<h3 style="text-align:center">Kaz</h3>
Kaz followed East Stave toward the harbor, through the beginnings of the
Barrel’s gambling district. The infamous tangle of narrow streets and minor
waterways known as the Barrel was bracketed by two major canals, East
Stave and West Stave, each catering to a particular clientele. The buildings
of the Barrel were different from anywhere else in Ketterdam, bigger,
wider, painted in every garish color, clamoring for attention from passersby
—the Treasure Chest, the Golden Bend, Weddell’s Riverboat. The best of
the betting halls were located farther north, in the prime real estate of the
Lid, the section of the canal closest to the harbors, favorably situated to
attract tourists and sailors coming into port.
    <i>But not the Crow Club</i>, Kaz mused as he looked up at the black-and-
crimson facade. It had taken a lot to lure tourists and risk-hungry merchers
this far south for entertainment. Now the hour was coming up on four bells,
and the crowds were still thick outside the club. Kaz watched the tide of
people flowing past the portico’s black columns, beneath the watchful eye
of the oxidized silver crow that spread its wings above the entrance. <i>Bless
the pigeons</i>, he thought. <i>Bless all you kind and generous folk ready to empty
your wallets into the Dregs’ coffers and call it a good time.</i>
    He could see barkers out front shouting to potential customers, offering
free drinks, hot pots of coffee, and the fairest deal in all of Ketterdam. He
acknowledged them with a nod and pressed farther north.
    Only one other gambling den on the Stave mattered to him: the Emerald
Palace, Pekka Rollins’ pride and joy. The building was an ugly green,
decked out in artificial trees laden with fake gold and silver coins. The
whole place had been done up as some kind of tribute to Rollins’ Kaelish
heritage and his gang, the Dime Lions. Even the girls working the chip
counters and tables wore glittering green sheaths of silk and had their hair
tinted a dark, unnatural red to mimic the look of girls from the Wandering
Isle. As Kaz passed the Emerald, he looked up at the false gold coins,
letting the anger come at him. He needed it tonight as a reminder of what
he’d lost, of what he stood to gain. He needed it to prepare him for this
reckless endeavor.
    “Brick by brick,” he muttered to himself. They were the only words that
kept his rage in check, that prevented him from striding through the
Emerald’s garish gold-and-green doors, demanding a private audience with
Rollins, and slitting his throat. Brick by brick. It was the promise that let
him sleep at night, that drove him every day, that kept Jordie’s ghost at bay.
Because a quick death was too good for Pekka Rollins.
    Kaz watched the flow of customers in and out of the Emerald’s doors
and caught a glimpse of his own steerers, men and women he hired to
seduce Pekka’s customers south with the prospect of better deals, bigger
wins, prettier girls.
    “Where are you coming from, looking so flush?” one said to the other,
talking far more loudly than necessary.
    “Just got back from the Crow Club. Took one hundred kruge off the
house in just two hours.”
    “You don’t say!”
    “I do! Just came up the Stave to get a beer and meet a friend. Why don’t
you join us, and we’ll all go together?”
    “The Crow Club! Who would have thought it?”
    “Come on, I’ll buy you a drink. I’ll buy everyone a drink!”
    And they walked off together laughing, leaving all the patrons around
them to wonder if maybe they ought to head just a few bridges down the
canal and see if the odds weren’t kinder there—Kaz’s servant, greed, luring
them south like a piper with flute in hand.
    He made sure to cycle steerers in and out, changing the faces so Pekka’s
barkers and bouncers never got wise, and customer by customer, he leeched
away the Emerald’s business. It was one of the infinite tiny ways he’d
found to make himself strong at Pekka’s expense—intercepting his
shipments of jurda, charging him fees for access to Fifth Harbor,
undercutting his rents to keep his properties free of tenants, and slowly,
slowly tugging at the threads that made up his life.
    Despite the lies he’d spread and the claims he’d made to Geels tonight,
Kaz wasn’t a bastard. He wasn’t even from Ketterdam. He’d been nine and
Jordie thirteen when they’d first arrived in the city, a check from the sale of
their father’s farm sewn safely into the inner pocket of Jordie’s old coat.
Kaz could see himself as he was then, walking the Stave with dazzled eyes,
hand tucked into Jordie’s so he wouldn’t be swept away by the crowd. He
hated the boys they’d been, two stupid pigeons waiting to be plucked. But
those boys were long gone, and only Pekka Rollins was left to punish.
    One day Rollins would come to Kaz on his knees, begging for help. If
Kaz managed this job for Van Eck, that day would come much sooner than
he ever could have hoped. Brick by brick, I will destroy you.
    But if Kaz had any hope of getting into the Ice Court, he needed the
right crew, and the next hour’s business would bring him a step closer to
securing two very vital pieces of the puzzle.
    He turned onto a walkway bordering one of the smaller canals. The
tourists and merchers liked to keep to well-lit thoroughfares, so the foot
traffic here was sparser, and he made better time. Soon, the lights and music
of West Stave came into view, the canal choked with men and women of
every class and country seeking diversion.
Music floated out of parlors where the doors had been flung open, and
men and women lounged on couches in little more than scraps of silk and
gaudy baubles. Acrobats dangled from cords over the canal, lithe bodies
garbed in nothing but glitter, while street performers played their fiddles,
hoping to garner a coin or two from passersby. Hawkers shouted at the
sleek private gondels of rich merchers in the canal and the larger browboats
that brought tourists and sailors inland from the Lid.
A lot of tourists never entered the brothels of West Stave. They just
came to watch the crowd, which was a sight in itself. Many people chose to
visit this part of the Barrel in disguise—in veils or masks or capes with
nothing but the glint of their eyes visible. They bought their costumes in
one of the specialty shops off the main canals, and sometimes disappeared
from their companions for a day or a week, or however long their funds
held out. They dressed as Mister Crimson or the Lost Bride, or wore the
grotesque, goggle-eyed mask of the Madman—all characters from the
Komedie Brute. And then there were the Jackals, a group of rowdy men and
boys who cavorted through the Barrel in the red lacquered masks of Suli
fortune-tellers.
Kaz remembered when Inej had first seen the jackal masks in a shop
window. She hadn’t been able to contain her contempt. “Real Suli fortune 
tellers are rare. They’re holy men and women. These masks that are handed
around like party favors are sacred symbols.”
“I’ve seen Suli tellers ply their trade in caravans and pleasure ships,
Inej. They didn’t seem so very holy.”
“They are pretenders. Making themselves clowns for you and your ilk.”
“My ilk?” Kaz had laughed.
She’d waved her hand in disgust. “Shevrati,” she’d said. “Know-nothings. 
They’re laughing at you behind those masks.”
“Not at me, Inej. I’d never lay down good coin to be told my future by
anyone—fraud or holy man.”
“Fate has plans for us all, Kaz.”
“Was it fate that took you from your family and stuck you in a pleasure
house in Ketterdam? Or was it just very bad luck?”
“I’m not sure yet,” she’d said coldly.
In moments like that, he thought she might hate him.
Kaz wove his way through the crowd, a shadow in a riot of color. Each
of the major pleasure houses had a specialty, some more obvious than
others. He passed the Blue Iris, the Bandycat, bearded men glowering from
the windows of the Forge, the Obscura, the Willow Switch, the dewy-eyed
blondes at the House of Snow, and of course the Menagerie, also known as
the House of Exotics, where Inej had been forced to don fake Suli silks. He
spotted Tante Heleen in her peacock feathers and famous diamond choker
holding court in the gilded parlor. She ran the Menagerie, procured the girls,
made sure they behaved. When she saw Kaz, her lips thinned to a sour line,
and she lifted her glass, the gesture more threat than toast. He ignored her
and pressed on.
The House of the White Rose was one of the more luxurious
establishments on West Stave. It had its own dock, and its gleaming white
stone facade looked less like a pleasure house than a mercher mansion. Its
window boxes were always bursting with climbing white roses, and their
scent clung dense and sweet over this portion of the canal.
The parlor was even stickier with perfume. Huge alabaster vases
overflowed with more white roses, and men and women—some masked or
veiled, some with faces bare—waited on ivory couches, sipping near-colorless 
wine and nibbling little vanilla cakes soaked in almond liqueur.
The boy at the desk was dressed in a creamy velvet suit, a white rose in
his buttonhole. He had white hair and colorless eyes. Barring the eyes, he
looked like an albino, but Kaz happened to know that he’d been tailored to
match the decor of the House by a certain Grisha on the payroll.
“Mister Brekker,” the boy said, “Nina is with a client.”
Kaz nodded and slipped down a hallway behind a potted rose tree,
resisting the urge to bury his nose in his collar. Onkle Felix, the bawd who
ran the White Rose, liked to say that his house girls were as sweet as his
blossoms. But the joke was on the clients. That particular breed of white
rose, the only one hardy enough to survive the wet weather of Ketterdam,
had no natural scent. All the flowers were perfumed by hand.
Kaz trailed his fingers along the panels behind the potted tree and
pressed his thumb into a notch in the wall. It slid open, and he climbed a
corkscrew staircase that was only used by staff.
Nina’s room was on the third floor. The door to the bedroom beside it
was open and the room unoccupied, so Kaz slipped in, moved aside a still
life, and pressed his face to the wall. The peepholes were a feature of all the
brothels. They were a way to keep employees safe and honest, and they
offered a thrill to anyone who enjoyed watching others take their pleasure.
Kaz had seen enough slum dwellers seeking satisfaction in dark corners and
alleys that the allure was lost on him. Besides, he knew that anyone looking
through this particular peephole and hoping for excitement would be sorely
disappointed.
A little bald man was seated fully clothed at a round table draped in
ivory baize, his hands neatly folded beside an untouched silver coffee tray.
Nina Zenik stood behind him, swathed in the red silk kefta that advertised
her status as a Grisha Heartrender, one palm pressed to his forehead, the
other to the back of his neck. She was tall and built like the figurehead of a
ship carved by a generous hand. They were silent, as if they’d been frozen
there at the table. There wasn’t even a bed in the room, just a narrow settee
where Nina curled up every night.
When Kaz had asked Nina why, she’d simply said, “I don’t want anyone
getting ideas.”
“A man doesn’t need a bed to get ideas, Nina.”
Nina fluttered her lashes. “What would you know about it, Kaz? Take
those gloves off, and we’ll see what ideas come to mind.”
Kaz had kept his cool eyes on her until she’d dropped her gaze. He
wasn’t interested in flirting with Nina Zenik, and he happened to know she
wasn’t remotely interested in him. Nina just liked to flirt with everything.
He’d once seen her make eyes at a pair of shoes she fancied in a shop
window.
Nina and the bald man sat, unspeaking, as the minutes ticked by, and
when the hour on the clock chimed, he rose and kissed her hand.
“Go,” she said in solemn tones. “Be at peace.”
The bald man kissed her hand again, tears in his eyes. “Thank you.”
As soon as the client was down the hall, Kaz stepped out of the bedroom
and knocked on Nina’s door.
She opened it cautiously, keeping the chain latched. “Oh,” she said when
she saw Kaz. “You.”
She didn’t look particularly happy to see him. No surprise. Kaz Brekker
at your door was rarely a good thing. She unhooked the chain and let him
show himself in as she shucked off the red kefta, revealing a slip of satin so
thin it barely counted as cloth.
“Saints, I hate this thing,” she said, kicking the kefta away and pulling a
threadbare dressing gown from a drawer.
“What’s wrong with it?” Kaz asked.
“It isn’t made right. And it itches.” The kefta was of Kerch manufacture,
not Ravkan—a costume, not a uniform. Kaz knew Nina never wore it on the
streets; it was simply too risky for Grisha. Her membership in the Dregs
meant anyone acting against her would risk retribution from the gang, but
payback wouldn’t matter much to Nina if she was on a slaver ship bound
for who knew where.
Nina threw herself into a chair at the table and wriggled her feet out of
her jeweled slippers, digging her toes into the plush white carpet. “Ahhh,”
she said contentedly. “So much better.” She shoved one of the cakes from
the coffee service into her mouth and mumbled, “What do you want, Kaz?”
“You have crumbs on your cleavage.”
“Don’t care,” she said, taking another bite of cake. “So hungry.”
Kaz shook his head, amused and impressed at how quickly Nina
dropped the wise Grisha priestess act. She’d missed her true calling on the
stage. “Was that Van Aakster, the merch?” Kaz asked.
“Yes.”
“His wife died a month ago, and his business has been a wreck since.
Now that he’s visiting you, can we expect a turnaround?”
Nina didn’t need a bed because she specialized in emotions. She dealt in
joy, calm, confidence. Most Grisha Corporalki focused on the body—to kill
or to cure—but Nina had needed a job that would keep her in Ketterdam
and out of trouble. So instead of risking her life and making major money
as a mercenary, she slowed heartbeats, eased breathing, relaxed muscles.
She had a lucrative side business as a Tailor, seeing to the wrinkles and
jowls of the wealthy Kerch, but her chief source of income came from
altering moods. People came to her lonely, grieving, sad for no reason, and
left buoyed, their anxieties eased. The effect didn’t last long, but sometimes
just the illusion of happiness was enough to make her clients feel like they
could face another day. Nina claimed it had something to do with glands,
but Kaz didn’t care about the specifics as long as she showed up when he
needed her and she paid Per Haskell his percentage on time.
“I expect you’ll see a change,” Nina said. She finished off the last cake,
licking her fingers with relish, then set the tray outside the door and rang for
a maid. “Van Aakster started coming at the end of last week and has been
here every day since.”
“Excellent.” Kaz made a mental note to buy up some of the low stock in
Van Aakster’s company. Even if the man’s mood shift was the result of
Nina’s handiwork, business would pick up. He hesitated then said, “You
make him feel better, ease his woe and all that … but could you compel him
to do something? Maybe make him forget his wife?”
“Alter the pathways in his mind? Don’t be absurd.”
“The brain is just another organ,” Kaz said, quoting Van Eck.
“Yes, but it’s an incredibly complex one. Controlling or altering another
person’s thoughts … well, it’s not like lowering a pulse rate or releasing a
chemical to improve someone’s mood. There are too many variables. No
Grisha is capable of it.”
Yet, Kaz amended. “So you treat the symptom, not the cause.”
She shrugged. “He’s avoiding the grief, not treating it. If I’m his
solution, he’ll never really get over her death.”
“Will you send him on his way then? Advise him to find a new wife and
stop darkening your door?”
She ran a brush through her light brown hair and glanced at him in the
mirror. “Does Per Haskell have plans to forgive my debt?”
“None at all.”
“Well then Van Aakster must be allowed to grieve in his own way. I
have another client scheduled in a half hour, Kaz. What business?”
“Your client will wait. What do you know about jurda parem?”
Nina shrugged. “There are rumors, but they sound like nonsense to me.”
With the exception of the Council of Tides, the few Grisha working in
Ketterdam all knew each other and exchanged information readily. Most
were on the run from something, eager to avoid drawing the attention of
slavers or interest from the Ravkan government.
“They aren’t just rumors.”
“Squallers flying? Tidemakers turning to mist?”
“Fabrikators making gold from lead.” He reached into his pocket and
tossed the lump of yellow to her. “It’s real.”
“Fabrikators make textiles. They fuss around with metals and fabrics.
They can’t turn one thing into another.” She held the lump up to the light.
“You could have gotten this anywhere,” she said, just as he had argued to
Van Eck a few hours earlier.
Without being invited, Kaz sat down on the plush settee and stretched
out his bad leg. “Jurda parem is real, Nina, and if you’re still the good little
Grisha soldier I think you are, you’ll want to hear what it does to people
like you.”
She turned the lump of gold over her in her hands, then wrapped her
dressing gown more tightly around her and curled up at the end of the
settee. Again, Kaz marveled at the transformation. In these rooms, she
played the part her clients wanted to see—the powerful Grisha, serene in
her knowledge. But sitting there with her brow furrowed and her feet tucked
under her, she looked like what she truly was: a girl of seventeen, raised in
the sheltered luxury of the Little Palace, far from home and barely getting
by every day.
“Tell me,” she said.
Kaz talked. He held back on the specifics of Van Eck’s proposal, but he
told her about Bo Yul-Bayur, jurda parem, and the addictive properties of
the drug, placing particular emphasis on the recent theft of Ravkan military
documents.
“If this is all true, then Bo Yul-Bayur needs to be eliminated.”
“That is not the job, Nina.”
“This isn’t about money, Kaz.”
It was always about money. But Kaz knew a different kind of pressure
was required. Nina loved her country and loved her people. She still
believed in the future of Ravka and in the Second Army, the Grisha military
elite that had nearly disintegrated during the civil war. Nina’s friends back
in Ravka believed she was dead, a victim of Fjerdan witchhunters, and for
now, she wanted it to stay that way. But Kaz knew she hoped to return one
day.
“Nina, we’re going to retrieve Bo Yul-Bayur, and I need a Corporalnik
to do it. I want you on my crew.”
“Wherever he’s hiding out, once you find him, letting him live would be
the most outrageous kind of irresponsibility. My answer is no.”
“He isn’t hiding out. The Fjerdans have him at the Ice Court.”
Nina paused. “Then he’s as good as dead.”
“The Merchant Council doesn’t think so. They wouldn’t be going to this
trouble or offering up this kind of reward if they thought he’d been
neutralized. Van Eck was worried. I could see it.”
“The mercher you spoke to?”
“Yes. He claims their intelligence is good. If it’s not, well, I’ll take the
hit. But if Bo Yul-Bayur is alive, someone is going to try to break him out
of the Ice Court. Why shouldn’t it be us?”
“The Ice Court,” Nina repeated, and Kaz knew she’d begun to put the
pieces together. “You don’t just need a Corporalnik, do you?”
“No. I need someone who knows the Court inside and out.”
She leapt to her feet and began pacing, hands on hips, dressing gown
flapping. “You’re a little skiv, you know that? How many times have I come
to you, begging you to help Matthias? And now that you want
something…”
“Per Haskell isn’t running a charity.”
“Don’t put this on the old man,” she snapped. “If you’d wanted to help
me, you know you could have.”
“And why would I do that?”
She whirled on him. “Because … because…”
“When have I ever done something for nothing, Nina?”
She opened her mouth, closed it again.
“Do you know how many favors I would have had to call in? How many
bribes I’d have had to pay out to get Matthias Helvar out of prison? The
price was too high.”
“And now?” she managed, her eyes still blazing anger.
“Now, Helvar’s freedom is worth something.”
“It—”
He held up a hand to cut her off. “Worth something to me.”
Nina pressed her fingers to her temples. “Even if you could get to him,
Matthias would never agree to help you.”
“It’s just a question of leverage, Nina.”
“You don’t know him.”
“Don’t I? He’s a person like any other, driven by greed and pride and
pain. You should understand that better than anyone.”
“Helvar is driven by honor and only honor. You can’t bribe or bully
that.”
“That may have been true once, Nina, but it’s been a very long year.
Helvar is much changed.”
“You’ve seen him?” Her green eyes were wide, eager. There, thought
Kaz, the Barrel hasn’t beaten the hope out of you yet.
“I have.”
Nina took a deep, shuddering breath. “He wants his revenge, Kaz.”
“That’s what he wants, not what he needs,” said Kaz. “Leverage is all
about knowing the difference.”
