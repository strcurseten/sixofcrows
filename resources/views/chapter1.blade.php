<h3 style="text-align:center">Joost</h3>
Joost had two problems: the moon and his mustache.
    He was supposed to be making his rounds at the Hoede house, but for
the last fifteen minutes, he’d been hovering around the southeast wall of the
gardens, trying to think of something clever and romantic to say to Anya.
    If only Anya’s eyes were blue like the sea or green like an emerald.
Instead, her eyes were brown—lovely, dreamy … melted chocolate brown?
Rabbit fur brown?
    “Just tell her she’s got skin like moonlight,” his friend Pieter had said.
“Girls love that.”
    A perfect solution, but the Ketterdam weather was not cooperating.
There’d been no breeze off the harbor that day, and a gray milk fog had
wreathed the city’s canals and crooked alleys in damp. Even here among the
mansions of the Geldstraat, the air hung thick with the smell of fish and
bilge water, and smoke from the refineries on the city’s outer islands had
smeared the night sky in a briny haze. The full moon looked less like a
jewel than a yellowy blister in need of lancing.
    Maybe he could compliment Anya’s laugh? Except he’d never heard her
laugh. He wasn’t very good with jokes.
    Joost glanced at his reflection in one of the glass panels set into the
double doors that led from the house to the side garden. His mother was
right. Even in his new uniform, he still looked like a baby. Gently, he
brushed his finger along his upper lip. If only his mustache would come in.
It definitely felt thicker than yesterday.
    He’d been a guard in the stadwatch less than six weeks, and it wasn’t
nearly as exciting as he’d hoped. He thought he’d be running down thieves
in the Barrel or patrolling the harbors, getting first look at cargo coming in
on the docks. But ever since the assassination of that ambassador at the
town hall, the Merchant Council had been grumbling about security, so
where was he? Stuck walking in circles at some lucky mercher’s house. Not
just any mercher, though. Councilman Hoede was about as high placed in
Ketterdam government as a man could be. The kind of man who could
make a career.
Joost adjusted the set of his coat and rifle, then patted the weighted
baton at his hip. Maybe Hoede would take a liking to him. Sharp-eyed and
quick with the cudgel, Hoede would say. That fellow deserves a promotion.
    “Sergeant Joost Van Poel,” he whispered, savoring the sound of the
    words. “Captain Joost Van Poel.”
    “Stop gawking at yourself.”
Joost whirled, cheeks going hot as Henk and Rutger strode into the side
garden. They were both older, bigger, and broader of shoulder than Joost,
and they were house guards, private servants of Councilman Hoede. That
meant they wore his pale green livery, carried fancy rifles from Novyi Zem,
and never let Joost forget he was a lowly grunt from the city watch.
    “Petting that bit of fuzz isn’t going to make it grow any faster,” Rutger
said with a loud laugh.
Joost tried to summon some dignity. “I need to finish my rounds.”
Rutger elbowed Henk. “That means he’s going to go stick his head in
the Grisha workshop to get a look at his girl.”
    “Oh, Anya, won’t you use your Grisha magic to make my mustache
    grow?” Henk mocked.
Joost turned on his heel, cheeks burning, and strode down the eastern
side of the house. They’d been teasing him ever since he’d arrived. If it
hadn’t been for Anya, he probably would have pleaded with his captain for
a reassignment. He and Anya only ever exchanged a few words on his
rounds, but she was always the best part of his night.
And he had to admit, he liked Hoede’s house, too, the few peeks he’d
managed through the windows. Hoede had one of the grandest mansions on
the Geldstraat—floors set with gleaming squares of black and white stone,
shining dark wood walls lit by blown-glass chandeliers that floated like
jellyfish near the coffered ceilings. Sometimes Joost liked to pretend that it
was his house, that he was a rich mercher just out for a stroll through his
fine garden.
Before he rounded the corner, Joost took a deep breath. Anya, your eyes
are brown like … tree bark? He’d think of something. He was better off
being spontaneous anyway.
He was surprised to see the glass-paneled doors to the Grisha workshop
open. More than the hand-painted blue tiles in the kitchen or the mantels
laden with potted tulips, this workshop was a testimony to Hoede’s wealth.
Grisha indentures didn’t come cheap, and Hoede had three of them.
But Yuri wasn’t seated at the long worktable, and Anya was nowhere to
be seen. Only Retvenko was there, sprawled out on a chair in dark blue
robes, eyes shut, a book open on his chest.
Joost hovered in the doorway, then cleared his throat. “These doors
should be shut and locked at night.”
“House is like furnace,” Retvenko drawled without opening his eyes, his
Ravkan accent thick and rolling. “Tell Hoede I stop sweating, I close
doors.”
Retvenko was a Squaller, older than the other Grisha indentures, his hair
shot through with silver. There were rumors he’d fought for the losing side
in Ravka’s civil war and had fled to Kerch after the fighting.
“I’d be happy to present your complaints to Councilman Hoede,” Joost
lied. The house was always overheated, as if Hoede were under obligation
to burn coal, but Joost wasn’t going to be the one to mention it. “Until then
—”
“You bring news of Yuri?” Retvenko interrupted, finally opening his
heavily hooded eyes.
Joost glanced uneasily at the bowls of red grapes and heaps of burgundy
velvet on the worktable. Yuri had been working on bleeding color from the
fruit into curtains for Mistress Hoede, but he’d fallen badly ill a few days
ago, and Joost hadn’t seen him since. Dust had begun to gather on the
velvet, and the grapes were going bad.
“I haven’t heard anything.”
“Of course you hear nothing. Too busy strutting around in stupid purple
uniform.”
What was wrong with his uniform? And why did Retvenko even have to
be here? He was Hoede’s personal Squaller and often traveled with the
merchant’s most precious cargos, guaranteeing favorable winds to bring the
ships safely and quickly to harbor. Why couldn’t he be away at sea now?
“I think Yuri may be quarantined.”
“So helpful,” Retvenko said with a sneer. “You can stop craning neck
like hopeful goose,” he added. “Anya is gone.”
Joost felt his face heat again. “Where is she?” he asked, trying to sound
authoritative. “She should be in after dark.”
“One hour ago, Hoede takes her. Same as night he came for Yuri.”
“What do you mean, ‘he came for Yuri’? Yuri fell ill.”
“Hoede comes for Yuri, Yuri comes back sick. Two days later, Yuri
vanishes for good. Now Anya.”
For good?
“Maybe there was an emergency. If someone needed to be healed—”
“First Yuri, now Anya. I will be next, and no one will notice except poor
little Officer Joost. Go now.”
“If Councilman Hoede—”
Retvenko raised an arm and a gust of air slammed Joost backward. Joost
scrambled to keep his footing, grabbing for the doorframe.
“I said now.” Retvenko etched a circle in the air, and the door slammed
shut. Joost let go just in time to avoid having his fingers smashed, and
toppled into the side garden.
He got to his feet as quickly as he could, wiping muck from his uniform,
shame squirming in his belly. One of the glass panes in the door had
cracked from the force. Through it, he saw the Squaller smirking.
“That’s counting against your indenture,” Joost said, pointing to the
ruined pane. He hated how small and petty his voice sounded.
Retvenko waved his hand, and the doors trembled on their hinges.
Without meaning to, Joost took a step back.
“Go make your rounds, little watchdog,” Retvenko called.
“That went well,” snickered Rutger, leaning against the garden wall.
How long had he been standing there? “Don’t you have something
better to do than follow me around?” Joost asked.
“All guards are to report to the boathouse. Even you. Or are you too
busy making friends?”
“I was asking him to shut the door.”
Rutger shook his head. “You don’t ask. You tell. They’re servants. Not
honored guests.”
Joost fell into step beside him, insides still churning with humiliation.
The worst part was that Rutger was right. Retvenko had no business talking
to him that way. But what was Joost supposed to do? Even if he’d had the
courage to get into a fight with a Squaller, it would be like brawling with an
expensive vase. The Grisha weren’t just servants; they were Hoede’s
treasured possessions.
What had Retvenko meant about Yuri and Anya being taken, anyway?
Had he been covering for Anya? Grisha indentures were kept to the house
for good reason. To walk the streets without protection was to risk getting
plucked up by a slaver and never seen again. Maybe she’s meeting someone,
Joost speculated miserably.
His thoughts were interrupted by the blaze of light and activity down by
the boathouse that faced the canal. Across the water he could see other fine
mercher houses, tall and slender, the tidy gables of their rooftops making a
dark silhouette against the night sky, their gardens and boathouses lit by
glowing lanterns.
A few weeks before, Joost had been told that Hoede’s boathouse would
be undergoing improvements and to strike it from his rounds. But when he
and Rutger entered, he saw no paint or scaffolding. The gondels and oars
had been pushed up against the walls. The other house guards were there in
their sea-green livery, and Joost recognized two stadwatch guards in purple.
But most of the interior was taken up by a huge box—a kind of freestanding
cell that looked like it was made from reinforced steel, its seams thick with
rivets, a huge window embedded in one of its walls. The glass had a wavy
bent, and through it, Joost could see a girl seated at a table, clutching her
red silks tight around her. Behind her, a stadwatch guard stood at attention.
Anya, Joost realized with a start. Her brown eyes were wide and
frightened, her skin pale. The little boy sitting across from her looked
doubly terrified. His hair was sleep-mussed, and his legs dangled from the
chair, kicking nervously at the air.
“Why all the guards?” asked Joost. There had to be more than ten of
them crowded into the boathouse. Councilman Hoede was there, too, along
with a merchant Joost didn’t know, both of them dressed in mercher black.
Joost stood up straighter when he saw they were talking to the captain of
the stadwatch. He hoped he’d gotten all the garden mud off of his uniform.
“What is this?”
Rutger shrugged. “Who cares? It’s a break in the routine.”
Joost looked back through the glass. Anya was staring out at him, her
gaze unfocused. The day he’d arrived at Hoede house, she’d healed a bruise
on his cheek. It had been nothing, the yellow-green remnants of a crack
he’d taken to the face during a training exercise, but apparently Hoede had
caught sight of it and didn’t like his guards looking like thugs. Joost had
been sent to the Grisha workshop, and Anya had sat him down in a bright
square of late winter sunlight. Her cool fingers had passed over his skin,
and though the itch had been terrible, bare seconds later it was as if the
bruise had never been.
When Joost thanked her, Anya smiled and Joost was lost. He knew his
cause was hopeless. Even if she’d had any interest in him, he could never
afford to buy her indenture from Hoede, and she would never marry unless
Hoede decreed it. But it hadn’t stopped him from dropping by to say hello
or to bring her little gifts. She’d liked the map of Kerch best, a whimsical
drawing of their island nation, surrounded by mermaids swimming in the
True Sea and ships blown along by winds depicted as fat-cheeked men. It
was a cheap souvenir, the kind tourists bought along East Stave, but it had
seemed to please her.
Now he risked raising a hand in greeting. Anya showed no reaction.
“She can’t see you, moron,” laughed Rutger. “The glass is mirrored on
the other side.”
Joost’s cheeks pinked. “How was I to know that?”
“Open your eyes and pay attention for once.”
First Yuri, now Anya. “Why do they need a Grisha Healer? Is that boy
injured?”
“He looks fine to me.”
The captain and Hoede seemed to reach some kind of agreement.
Through the glass, Joost saw Hoede enter the cell and give the boy an
encouraging pat. There must have been vents in the cell because he heard
Hoede say, “Be a brave lad, and there’s a few kruge in it for you.” Then he
grabbed Anya’s chin with a liver-spotted hand. She tensed, and Joost’s gut
tightened. Hoede gave Anya’s head a little shake. “Do as you’re told, and
this will soon be over, ja?”
She gave a small, tight smile. “Of course, Onkle.”
Hoede whispered a few words to the guard behind Anya, then stepped
out. The door shut with a loud clang, and Hoede slid a heavy lock into
place.
Hoede and the other merchant took positions almost directly in front of
Joost and Rutger.
The merchant Joost didn’t know said, “You’re sure this is wise? This
girl is a Corporalnik. After what happened to your Fabrikator—”
“If it was Retvenko, I’d be worried. But Anya has a sweet disposition.
She’s a Healer. Not prone to aggression.”
“And you’ve lowered the dose?”
“Yes, but we’re agreed that if we have the same results as the Fabrikator,
the Council will compensate me? I can’t be asked to bear that expense.”
When the merchant nodded, Hoede signaled to the captain. “Proceed.”
The same results as the Fabrikator. Retvenko claimed Yuri had
vanished. Was that what he’d meant?
“Sergeant,” said the captain, “are you ready?”
The guard inside the cell replied, “Yes, sir.” He drew a knife.
Joost swallowed hard.
“First test,” said the captain.
The guard bent forward and told the boy to roll up his sleeve. The boy
obeyed and stuck out his arm, popping the thumb of his other hand into his
mouth. Too old for that, thought Joost. But the boy must be very scared.
Joost had slept with a sock bear until he was nearly fourteen, a fact his older
brothers had mocked mercilessly.
“This will sting just a bit,” said the guard.
The boy kept his thumb in his mouth and nodded, eyes round.
“This really isn’t necessary—” said Anya.
“Quiet, please,” said Hoede.
The guard gave the boy a pat then slashed a bright red cut across his
forearm. The boy started crying immediately.
Anya tried to rise from her chair, but the guard placed a stern hand on
her shoulder.
“It’s all right, sergeant,” said Hoede. “Let her heal him.”
Anya leaned forward, taking the boy’s hand gently. “Shhhh,” she said
softly. “Let me help.”
“Will it hurt?” the boy gulped.
She smiled. “Not at all. Just a little itch. Try to hold still for me?”
Joost found himself leaning closer. He’d never actually seen Anya heal
someone.
Anya removed a handkerchief from her sleeve and wiped away the
excess blood. Then her fingers brushed carefully over the boy’s wound.
Joost watched in astonishment as the skin slowly seemed to re-form and
knit together.
A few minutes later, the boy grinned and held out his arm. It looked a bit
red, but was otherwise smooth and unmarked. “Was that magic?”
Anya tapped him on the nose. “Of a sort. The same magic your own
body works when given time and a bit of bandage.”
The boy looked almost disappointed.
“Good, good,” Hoede said impatiently. “Now the parem.”
Joost frowned. He’d never heard that word.
The captain signaled to his sergeant. “Second sequence.”
“Put out your arm,” the sergeant said to the boy once again.
The boy shook his head. “I don’t like that part.”
“Do it.”
The boy’s lower lip quivered, but he put out his arm. The guard cut him
once more. Then he placed a small wax paper envelope on the table in front
of Anya.
“Swallow the contents of the packet,” Hoede instructed Anya.
“What is it?” she asked, voice trembling.
“That isn’t your concern.”
“What is it?” she repeated.
“It’s not going to kill you. We’re going to ask you to perform some
simple tasks to judge the drug’s effects. The sergeant is there to make sure
you do only what you’re told and no more, understood?”
Her jaw set, but she nodded.
“No one will harm you,” said Hoede. “But remember, if you hurt the
sergeant, you have no way out of that cell. The doors are locked from the
outside.”
“What is that stuff?” whispered Joost.
“Don’t know,” said Rutger.
“What do you know?” he muttered.
“Enough to keep my trap shut.”
Joost scowled.
With shaking hands, Anya lifted the little wax envelope and opened the
flap.
“Go on,” said Hoede.
She tipped her head back and swallowed the powder. For a moment she
sat, waiting, lips pressed together.
“Is it just jurda?” she asked hopefully. Joost found himself hoping, too.
Jurda was nothing to fear, a stimulant everyone in the stadwatch chewed to
stay awake on late watches.
“What does it taste like?” Hoede asked.
“Like jurda but sweeter, it—”
Anya inhaled sharply. Her hands seized the table, her pupils dilating
enough that her eyes looked nearly black. “Ohhh,” she said, sighing. It was
nearly a purr.
The guard tightened his grip on her shoulder.
“How do you feel?”
She stared at the mirror and smiled. Her tongue peeked through her
white teeth, stained like rust. Joost felt suddenly cold.
“Just as it was with the Fabrikator,” murmured the merchant.
“Heal the boy,” Hoede commanded.
She waved her hand through the air, the gesture almost dismissive, and
the cut on the boy’s arm sealed instantly. The blood lifted briefly from his
skin in droplets of red then vanished. His skin looked perfectly smooth, all
trace of blood or redness gone. The boy beamed. “That was definitely
magic.”
“It feels like magic,” Anya said with that same eerie smile.
“She didn’t touch him,” marveled the captain.
“Anya,” said Hoede. “Listen closely. We’re going to tell the guard to
perform the next test now.”
“Mmm,” hummed Anya.
“Sergeant,” said Hoede. “Cut off the boy’s thumb.”
The boy howled and started to cry again. He shoved his hands beneath
his legs to protect them.
I should stop this, Joost thought. I should find a way to protect her, both
of them. But what then? He was a nobody, new to the stadwatch, new to this
house. Besides, he discovered in a burst of shame, I want to keep my job.
Anya merely smiled and tilted her head back so she was looking at the
sergeant. “Shoot the glass.”
“What did she say?” asked the merchant.
“Sergeant!” the captain barked out.
“Shoot the glass,” Anya repeated. The sergeant’s face went slack. He
cocked his head to one side as if listening to a distant melody, then unslung
his rifle and aimed at the observation window.
“Get down!” someone yelled.
Joost threw himself to the ground, covering his head as the rapid
hammer of gunfire filled his ears and bits of glass rained down on his hands
and back. His thoughts were a panicked clamor. His mind tried to deny it,
but he knew what he’d just seen. Anya had commanded the sergeant to
shoot the glass. She’d made him do it. But that couldn’t be. Grisha
Corporalki specialized in the human body. They could stop your heart, slow
your breathing, snap your bones. They couldn’t get inside your head.
For a moment there was silence. Then Joost was on his feet with
everyone else, reaching for his rifle. Hoede and the captain shouted at the
same time.
“Subdue her!”
“Shoot her!”
“Do you know how much money she’s worth?” Hoede retorted.
“Someone restrain her! Do not shoot!”
Anya raised her hands, red sleeves spread wide. “Wait,” she said.
Joost’s panic vanished. He knew he’d been frightened, but his fear was a
distant thing. He was filled with expectation. He wasn’t sure what was
coming, or when, only that it would arrive and that it was essential he be
ready to meet it. It might be bad or good. He didn’t really care. His heart
was free of worry and desire. He longed for nothing, wanted for nothing,
his mind silent, his breath steady. He only needed to wait.
He saw Anya rise and pick up the little boy. He heard her crooning
tenderly to him, some Ravkan lullaby.
“Open the door and come in, Hoede,” she said. Joost heard the words,
understood them, forgot them.
Hoede walked to the door and slid the bolt free. He entered the steel
cell.
“Do as you’re told, and this will soon be over, ja?” Anya murmured
with a smile. Her eyes were black and bottomless pools. Her skin was
alight, glowing, incandescent. A thought flickered through Joost’s mind—
beautiful as the moon.
Anya shifted the boy’s weight in her arms. “Don’t look,” she murmured
against his hair. “Now,” she said to Hoede. “Pick up the knife.”
