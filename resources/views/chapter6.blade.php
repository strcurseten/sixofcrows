<h3 style="text-align:center">Nina</h3>
The sick feeling in Nina’s stomach had nothing to do with the rocking of
the rowboat. She tried to breathe deeply, to focus on the lights of the
Ketterdam harbor disappearing behind them and the steady splash of the
oars in the water. Beside her, Kaz adjusted his mask and cloak, while
Muzzen rowed with relentless and aggressive speed, driving them closer to
Terrenjel, one of Kerch’s tiny outlying islands, closer to Hellgate and
Matthias.
    Fog lay low over the water, damp and curling. It carried the smell of tar
and machinery from the shipyards on Imperjum, and something else—the
sweet stink of burning bodies from the Reaper’s Barge, where Ketterdam
disposed of the dead who couldn’t afford to be buried in the cemeteries
outside the city. <i>Disgusting</i>, Nina thought, drawing her cloak tighter around
her. Why anyone would want to live in a city like this was beyond her.
    Muzzen hummed happily as he rowed. Nina knew him only in passing
—a bouncer and an enforcer, like the ill-fated Big Bolliger. She avoided the
Slat and the Crow Club as much as possible. Kaz had branded her a snob
for it, but she didn’t much care what Kaz Brekker had to say about her
tastes. She glanced back at Muzzen’s huge shoulders. She wondered if Kaz
had just brought him along to row or because he expected trouble tonight.
    <i>Of course there will be trouble.</i> They were breaking into a prison. It
wasn’t going to be a party. <i>So why are we dressed for one?</i>
    She’d met Kaz and Muzzen at Fifth Harbor at midnight, and when she’d
boarded the little rowboat, Kaz had handed her a blue silk cape and a
matching veil—the trappings of the Lost Bride, one of the costumes
pleasure seekers liked to don when they sampled the excesses of the Barrel.
He’d had on a big orange cape with a Madman’s mask perched atop his
head; Muzzen had worn the same. All they needed was a stage, and they
could perform one of those dark, savage little scenes from the Komedie
Brute that the Kerch seemed to find so hilarious.
    Now Kaz gave her a nudge. “Lower your veil.” He pulled down his own
mask; the long nose and bulging eyes looked doubly monstrous in the fog.
    She was about to give in and ask why the costumes were necessary
when she realized that they weren’t alone. Through the shifting mists, she
caught sight of other boats moving through the water, carrying the shapes of
other Madmen, other Brides, a Mister Crimson, a Scarab Queen. What
business did these people have at Hellgate?
    Kaz had refused to tell her the specifics of his plan, and when she’d
insisted, he’d simply said, “Get in the boat.” That was Kaz all over. He
knew he didn’t have to tell her anything because the lure of Matthias’
freedom had already overridden every bit of her good sense. She’d been
trying to talk Kaz into breaking Matthias out of jail for the better part of a
year. Now he could offer Matthias more than freedom, but the price would
be far higher than she had expected.
    Only a few lights were visible as they approached the rocky shoal of
Terrenjel. The rest was darkness and crashing waves.
    “Couldn’t you just bribe the warden?” she muttered to Kaz.
    “I don’t need him knowing he has something I want.”
    When the boat’s hull scraped sand, two men rushed forward to haul
them farther onto land. The other boats she’d seen were making ground in
the same cove, being pulled ashore by more grunting and cursing men.
Their features were vague through the gauze of her veil, but Nina glimpsed
the tattoos on their forearms: a feral cat curled into a crown—the symbol of
the Dime Lions.
“Money,” one of them said as they clambered out of the boat.
Kaz handed over a stack of kruge and once it was counted, the Dime
Lion waved them on.
They followed a row of torches up an uneven path to the leeward side of
the prison. Nina tilted her head back to gaze at the high black towers of the
fortress known as Hellgate, a dark fist of stone thrusting up from the sea.
She’d seen it from afar before, when she’d paid a fisherman to take her out
to the island. But when she’d asked him to bring her closer, he’d refused.
“Sharks get mean there,” he’d claimed. “Bellies full of convict blood.” Nina
shuddered at the memory.
A door had been propped open, and another member of the Dime Lions
led Nina and the others inside. They entered a dark, surprisingly clean
kitchen, its walls lined with huge vats that looked better suited to laundry
than cooking. The room smelled strange, like vinegar and sage. Like a
mercher’s kitchen, Nina thought. The Kerch believed that work was akin to
prayer. Maybe the merchant wives came here to scrub the floors and walls
and windows, to honor Ghezen, the god of industry and commerce, with
soap and water and the chafing of their hands. Nina resisted the urge to gag.
They could scrub all they liked. Beneath that wholesome scent was the
indelible stench of mildew, urine, and unwashed bodies. It might take an
actual miracle to dislodge it.
They passed through a dank entry hall, and she thought they would head
up into the cells, but instead they passed through another door and onto a
high stone walkway that connected the main prison to what looked like
another tower.
“Where are we going?” Nina whispered. Kaz didn’t answer. The wind
picked up, lifting her veil and lashing her cheeks with salt spray.
As they entered the second tower, a figure emerged from the shadows,
and Nina barely stifled a scream.
“Inej,” she said on a wavering breath. The Suli girl wore the horns and
high-necked tunic of the Gray Imp, but Nina recognized her anyway. No
one else moved liked that, as if the world were smoke and she was just
passing through it.
“How did you even get here?” Nina whispered to her.
“I came earlier on a supply barge.”
Nina ground her teeth. “Do people just come and go from Hellgate for
fun?”
“Once a week they do,” said Inej, her little imp horns bobbing along
with her head.
“What do you mean once a—”
“Keep quiet,” Kaz growled.
“Don’t shush me, Brekker,” Nina whispered furiously. “If it’s this easy
to get into Hellgate—”
“The problem isn’t getting in, it’s getting out. Now shut up and stay
alert.”
Nina swallowed her anger. She had to trust Kaz to run the game. He’d
made sure she didn’t have any other choice.
They entered a tight passageway. This tower felt different from the first,
older, its rough-hewn stone walls blackened by smoking torches. Their
Dime Lion guide pushed open a heavy iron door and gestured for them to
follow him down a steep staircase. Here the smell of bodies and refuse was
worse, trapped by the sweating moisture of salt water.
They spiraled lower, into the bowels of the rock. Nina clung to the wall.
There was no banister, and though she could not see the bottom, she
doubted the fall would be kind. They didn’t go far, but by the time they
reached their destination, she was trembling, her muscles wound taut, less
from exertion than the knowledge that Matthias was somewhere in this
terrible place. He is here. He is under this roof.
“Where are we?” she whispered as they ducked through cramped stone
tunnels, passing dark caves fitted with iron bars.
“This is the old prison,” Kaz said. “When they built the new tower, they
left this one standing.”
She heard moaning from inside one of the cells.
“They still keep prisoners here?”
“Only the worst of them.”
She peered between the bars of an empty cell. There were shackles on
the wall, dark with rust and what might have been blood.
Through the walls, a sound reached Nina’s ears, a steady pounding. She
thought it was the ocean at first, but then she realized it was chanting. They
emerged into a curving tunnel. To her right were more old cells, but light
poured into the tunnel from staggered archways on the left, and through
them she glimpsed a roaring, rowdy crowd.
The Dime Lion led them around the tunnel to the third archway, where a
prison guard dressed in a blue-and-gray uniform was posted, rifle slung
across his back. “Four more for you,” the Dime Lion shouted over the
crowd. Then he turned to Kaz. “If you need to leave, the guard will call for
an escort. No one goes wandering off without a guide, understood?”
“Of course, of course, wouldn’t dream of it,” Kaz said from behind his
ridiculous mask.
“Enjoy,” the Dime Lion said with an ugly grin. The prison guard waved
them through.
Nina stepped under the arch and felt as if she’d fallen into some strange
nightmare. They were on a jutting stone ledge, looking down into a shallow,
crudely made amphitheater. The tower had been gutted to create an arena.
Only the black walls of the old prison remained, the roof long since fallen
in or destroyed so that the night sky was visible high above, dense with
clouds and free of stars. It was like standing in the hollowed-out trunk of a
massive tree, something long dead and howling with echoes.
Around her, masked and veiled men and women crowded onto the
terraced ledges, stamping their feet as the action proceeded below. The
walls surrounding the fighting pit blazed with torchlight and the sand of the
arena floor was red and damp where it had soaked up blood.
In front of the dark mouth of a cave, a scrawny, bearded man in shackles
stood next to a big wooden wheel marked with what looked like drawings
of little animals. He’d clearly once been strong, but now his skin hung in
loose folds and his muscles sagged. A younger man stood beside him in a
mangy cape made from a lion’s skin, his face framed by the big cat’s
mouth. A garish gold crown had been secured between the lion’s ears, and
its eyes had been replaced with bright silver dimes.
“Spin the wheel!” the young man commanded.
The prisoner lifted his shackled hands and gave the wheel a hard spin. A
red needle ticked along the edges as it spun, making a cheerful clattering
noise, then slowly the wheel came to a stop. Nina couldn’t quite make out
the symbol, but the crowd bellowed, and the man’s shoulders drooped as a
guard came forward to unlock his chains.
The prisoner cast them aside into the sand, and a second later Nina
heard it—a roar that carried even over the excited baying of the crowd. The
man in the lion cape and the prison guard stepped hurriedly onto a rope
ladder and were lifted out of the pit to the safety of a ledge as the prisoner
seized a flimsy-looking knife from a bloody bunch of weapons lying in the
sand. He backed as far away from the mouth of the tunnel as he could get.
Nina had never seen a creature like the one that crawled into view from
the tunnel. It was some kind of reptile, its thick body covered in gray-green
scales, its head wide and flat, its yellow eyes slitted. It moved slowly,
sinuously, its low-slung body sliding lazily over the ground. There was a
white crust around the broad crescent of its mouth, and when it opened its
jaws to roar again, something wet, white, and foaming dripped from its
pointed teeth.
“What is that thing?” Nina asked.
“Rinca moten,” said Inej. “A desert lizard. The poison from its mouth is
lethal.”
“It seems pretty slow on its feet.”
“Yes. It seems that way.”
The prisoner lunged forward with his knife. The big lizard moved so
quickly Nina could barely track it. One moment the prisoner was bearing
down on it; the next, the lizard was on the other side of the arena. Bare
seconds later, it had slammed into the prisoner, pinning him to the ground
as he screamed, its poison dripping over his face, leaving smoky trails
wherever it touched his skin.
The creature dropped its weight on the prisoner with a sickening crunch
and set about slowly mauling his shoulder as he lay there shrieking.
The crowd was booing.
Nina averted her eyes, unable to watch. “What is this?”
“Welcome to the Hellshow,” said Kaz. “Pekka Rollins got the idea a few
years back and pitched it to the right Council member.”
“The Merchant Council knows?”
“Of course they know, Nina. There’s money to be made here.”
Nina dug her fingernails into her palms. That condescending tone made
Kaz so slappable.
She knew Pekka Rollins’ name well. He was the reigning king of the
Barrel, the owner of not one but two gambling palaces—one luxurious, the
other catering to sailors with less to line their pockets—and several of the
higher-end brothels. When Nina had arrived in Ketterdam a year ago, she’d
been friendless, penniless, and far from home. She’d spent the first week in
the Kerch law courts, dealing with the charges against Matthias. But once
her testimony was complete, she’d been unceremoniously dumped at First
Harbor with just enough money to book passage back to Ravka. Desperate
as she’d been to return to her country, she’d known she couldn’t leave
Matthias to languish in Hellgate.
She had no idea what to do, but it seemed rumors of a new Grisha
Corporalnik in Ketterdam had already circulated through the city. Pekka
Rollins’ men had been waiting for her at the harbor with the promise of
safety and a place to stay. They’d taken her to the Emerald Palace, where
Pekka himself had leaned heavily on Nina to join the Dime Lions and had
offered to set her up in business at the Sweet Shop. She’d been close to
saying yes, desperate for cash and terrified of the slavers who patrolled the
streets. But that night, Inej had crawled through her window on the top floor
of the Emerald Palace with a proposal from Kaz Brekker in hand.
Nina never could figure out how Inej had managed to scale six rain-slick
stories of stone in the middle of the night, but the Dregs’ terms were far
more favorable than those offered by Pekka and the Dime Lions. It was a
contract that she might actually pay off in a year or two if she was smart
with her money. And Kaz had sent the right person to argue his case—a
Suli girl just a few months younger than Nina who had grown up in Ravka
and who had spent a very ugly year indentured at the Menagerie.
“What can you tell me about Per Haskell?” Nina had asked that night.
“Not much,” Inej had admitted. “He’s no better or worse than most of
the bosses in the Barrel.”
“And Kaz Brekker?”
“A liar, a thief, and utterly without conscience. But he’ll keep to any
deal you strike with him.”
Nina had heard the conviction in her voice. “He freed you from the
Menagerie?”
“There is no freedom in the Barrel, only good terms. Tante Heleen’s
girls never earn out of their contracts. She makes sure they don’t. She—”
Inej had broken off then, and Nina had sensed the vibrant anger coursing
through her. “Kaz convinced Per Haskell to pay off my indenture. I would
have died at the Menagerie.”
“You may still die in the Dregs.”
Inej’s dark eyes had glinted. “I may. But I’ll die on my feet with a knife
in my hand.”
The next morning, Inej had helped Nina sneak out of the Emerald
Palace. They’d met with Kaz Brekker, and despite his cold ways and those
strange leather gloves, she’d agreed to join the Dregs and work out of the
White Rose. Less than two days later, a girl died at the Sweet Shop,
strangled in her bed by a customer dressed as Mister Crimson who was
never found.
Nina had trusted Inej, and she hadn’t been sorry for it, though right now
she just felt furious with everyone. She watched a group of Dime Lions
prod the desert lizard with long spears. Apparently, the monster was sated
after its meal; it allowed itself to be herded back to the tunnel, its thick body
moving side to side in a lazy, sinuous roll.
The crowd continued to boo as guards entered the arena to remove the
prisoner’s remains, tendrils of smoke still curling from his ruined flesh.
“Why are they complaining?” Nina asked angrily. “Isn’t this what they
came here for?”
“They wanted a fight,” said Kaz. “They were expecting him to last
longer.”
“This is disgusting.”
Kaz shrugged. “Only disgusting thing about it is that I didn’t think of it
first.”
“These men aren’t slaves, Kaz. They’re prisoners.”
“They’re murderers and rapists.”
“And thieves and con artists. Your people.”
“Nina, sweet, they aren’t forced to fight. They line up for the chance.
They earn better food, private cells, liquor, jurda, conjugals with girls from
West Stave.”
Muzzen cracked his knuckles. “Sounds better than we got it at the Slat.”
Nina looked at the people screaming and shouting, the barkers walking
the aisles taking bets. The prisoners of Hellgate might line up to fight, but
Pekka Rollins made the real money.
“Helvar doesn’t … Helvar doesn’t fight in the arena, does he?”
“We aren’t here for the ambience,” Kaz said.
Beyond slappable. “Are you aware that I could waggle my fingers and
make you wet your trousers?”
“Easy, Heartrender. I like these trousers. And if you start messing with
my vital organs, Matthias Helvar will never see sunshine again.”
Nina blew out a breath and settled for glowering at no one.
“Nina—” Inej murmured.
“Don’t you start in on me.”
“It will all work out. Let Kaz do what he does best.”
“He’s horrible.”
“But effective. Being angry at Kaz for being ruthless is like being angry
at a stove for being hot. You know what he is.”
Nina crossed her arms. “I’m mad at you, too.”
“Me? Why?”
“I don’t know yet. I just am.”
Inej gave Nina’s hand a brief squeeze, and after a moment, Nina
squeezed back. She sat through the next fight in a daze, and the next. She
told herself she was ready for this—to see him again, to see him here in this
brutal place. After all, she was a Grisha and a soldier of the Second Army.
She’d seen worse.
But when Matthias emerged from the mouth of the cave below, she
knew she’d been wrong. Nina recognized him instantly. Every night of the
past year, she had fallen asleep thinking of Matthias’ face. There was no
mistaking the gilded brows, the sharp cut of his cheekbones. But Kaz hadn’t
lied: Matthias was much changed. The boy who looked back at the crowd
with fury in his eyes was a stranger.
Nina remembered the first time she’d seen Matthias in a moonlit Kaelish
wood. His beauty had seemed unfair to her. In another life, she might have
believed he was coming to rescue her, a shining savior with golden hair and
eyes the pale blue of northern glaciers. But she’d known the truth of him by
the language he spoke, and by the disgust on his face every time his eyes
lighted on her. Matthias Helvar was a drüskelle, one of the Fjerdan
witchhunters tasked with hunting down Grisha to face trial and execution,
though to her he’d always resembled a warrior Saint, illuminated in gold.
Now he looked like what he truly was: a killer. His bare torso seemed
hewn from steel, and though she knew it wasn’t possible, he seemed bigger,
as if the very structure of his body had changed. His skin had been gilded
honey; now it was fish-belly white beneath the grime. And his hair—he’d
had such beautiful hair, thick and golden, worn long in the way of Fjerdan
soldiers. Now, like the other prisoners, his head had been shaved, probably
to prevent lice. Whichever guard had done it had made a mess of the job.
Even from this distance, she could see the cuts and nicks on his scalp, and
little strips of blond stubble in the places the razor had missed. And yet, he
was beautiful still.
He glared at the crowd and gave the wheel a hard spin that nearly
knocked it off its base.
Tick tick tick tick. Snakes. Tiger. Bear. Boar. The wheel ticked merrily
along, then slowed and finally stopped.
“No,” Nina said when she saw where the needle was pointing.
“It could be worse,” said Muzzen. “Could have landed on the desert
lizard again.”
She grabbed Kaz’s arm through his cloak and felt his muscles tense.
“You have to stop this.”
“Let go of me, Nina.” His gravel-rough voice was low, but she sensed
real menace in it.
She dropped her hand, “Please, you don’t understand. He—”
“If he survives, I’ll take Matthias Helvar out of this place tonight, but
this part is up to him.”
Nina gave a frustrated shake of her head. “You don’t get it.”
The guard unbolted Matthias’ shackles, and as soon as the chains
dropped into the sand, he leapt onto the ladder with the announcer to be
lifted to safety. The crowd screamed and stamped. But Matthias stood
silent, unmoving, even when the gate opened, even when the wolves
charged out of the tunnel—three of them snarling and snapping, tumbling
over one another to get to him.
At the last second, Matthias dropped into a crouch, knocking the first
wolf into the dirt, then rolling right to pick up the bloodied knife the
previous combatant had left in the sand. He sprang to his feet, blade held
out before him, but Nina could sense his reluctance. His head was cocked to
one side, and the look in his blue eyes was pleading, as if he was trying to
engage the two wolves circling him in some silent negotiation. Whatever
the plea might have been, it went unheard. The wolf on the right lunged.
Matthias crouched low and spun, lodging his knife in the wolf’s belly. It
gave a miserable yelp, and Matthias seemed to shudder at the sound. It cost
him precious seconds. The third wolf was on him, knocking him to the
sand. Its teeth sank into his shoulder. He rolled, taking the wolf with him.
The wolf’s jaws snapped, and Matthias caught them. He wrenched them
apart, the muscles of his arms flexing, his face grim. Nina squeezed her
eyes shut. There was a sickening crack. The crowd roared.
Matthias knelt over the wolf. Its jaw was broken, and it lay on the
ground twitching in pain. He reached for a rock and slammed it hard into
the poor animal’s skull. It went still and Matthias’ shoulders slumped. The
people howled, stomping their feet. Only Nina knew what this was costing
him, that he’d been a drüskelle. Wolves were sacred to his kind, bred for
battle like their enormous horses. They were friends and companions,
fighting side by side with their drüskelle masters.
The first wolf had recovered and was circling. Move, Matthias, she
thought desperately. He got to his feet, but his movements were slow,
weary. His heart wasn’t in this fight. His opponents were gray wolves,
rangy and wild, but cousins to the white wolves of the Fjerdan north.
Matthias had no knife, only the bloody rock in his hand, and the remaining
wolf prowled the arena between him and the pile of weapons. The wolf
lowered its head and bared its teeth.
Matthias dove left. The wolf lunged, sinking its teeth into his side. He
grunted, and hit the ground hard. For a moment, Nina thought he might
simply give in and let the wolf take his life. Then he reached out, hand
scrabbling through the sand, searching for something. His fingers closed
over the shackles that had bound his wrists.
He seized them, looped the chain across the wolf’s throat, and pulled,
the veins in his neck cording from the strain. His bloody face was pressed
against the wolf’s ruff, his eyes tightly shut, his lips moving. What was he
saying? A drüskelle prayer? A farewell?
The wolf’s hind legs scrabbled at the sand. Its eyes rolled, frightened
whites showing bright against its matted fur. A high whine rose from its
chest. And then it was over. The creature’s body stilled. Both fighters lay
unmoving in the sand. Matthias kept his eyes closed, his face still buried in
the creature’s fur.
The crowd thundered its approval. The ladder was lowered, and the
announcer sprang down, hauling Matthias to his feet and grabbing his wrist
to raise his hand in victory. The announcer gave him a little nudge, and
Matthias lifted his head. Nina caught her breath.
Tears streaked the dirt on Matthias’ face. The rage was gone, and it was
like some flame had gone out with it. His north sea eyes were colder than
she’d ever seen them, empty of feeling, stripped of anything human at all.
This was what Hellgate had done to him. And it was her fault.
The guards took hold of Matthias again, pulling the shackles from the
wolf’s throat and clapping them back on his wrists. As he was led away, the
crowd chanted its disapproval, clamoring “More! More!”
“Where are they taking him?” Nina asked, voice trembling.
“To a cell to sleep off the fight,” Kaz said.
“Who will see to his injuries?”
“They have mediks. We’ll wait to make sure he’s alone.”
I could heal him, she thought. But a darker voice rose in her, rich with
mocking. Not even you can be that foolish, Nina. No Healer can cure that
boy. You made sure of it.
She thought she would leap from her skin as the minutes burned away.
The others watched the next fight—Muzzen avidly, flexing his fingers and
speculating on the outcome, Inej silent and still as a statue, Kaz inscrutable
as always, scheming away behind that hideous mask. Nina slowed her own
breathing, forced her pulse lower, trying to calm herself, but she could do
nothing to mute the riot in her head.
Finally, Kaz gave her a nudge. “Ready, Nina? The guard first.”
She cast a glance at the prison guard standing by the archway.
“How down?” It was a Barrel turn of phrase. How badly do you want
him hurt?
“Shut eye.” Knock him out, but don’t actually hurt him.
They followed Kaz to the arch through which they’d entered. The rest of
the crowd took little notice, eyes focused on the fighting below.
“Need your escort?” the guard asked as they approached.
“I had a question,” said Kaz. Beneath her cape, Nina lifted her hands,
sensing the flow of blood in the guard’s veins, the tissue of his lungs.
“About your mother and whether the rumors are true.”
Nina felt the guard’s pulse leap and sighed. “Never can make it easy, can
you, Kaz?”
The guard stepped forward, lifting his gun. “What did you say? I—” His
eyelids drooped. “You don’t—” Nina dropped his pulse, and he toppled
forward.
Muzzen grabbed him before he could fall as Inej swept him into the
cloak Kaz had been wearing just moments before. Nina was only mildly
surprised to see that Kaz was wearing a prison guard’s uniform beneath it.
“Couldn’t you have just asked him the time or something?” Nina said.
“And where did you get that uniform?”
Inej slid the Madman’s mask down over the guard’s face, and Muzzen
threw his arm around him, holding him up as if the guard had been drinking
too much. They deposited him on one of the benches pressed against the
back wall.
Kaz tugged on the sleeves of his uniform. “Nina, people love to give up
authority to men in nice clothes. I have uniforms for the stadwatch, the
harbor police, and the livery of every merch mansion on the Geldstraat.
Let’s go.”
They slipped down the passageway.
Instead of turning back the way they’d come, they moved
counterclockwise around the old tower, the wall of the arena vibrating with
voices and stomping feet to their left. The guards posted at each archway
paid them little more than a glance, though a few nodded at Kaz, who kept a
brisk pace, his face buried in his collar.
Nina was so deep in thought that she nearly missed it when Kaz held up
a hand for them to slow. They’d rounded a bend between two archways and
were in the cover of deep shadow. Ahead of them, a medik was emerging
from a cell accompanied by guards, one carrying a lantern. “He’ll sleep
through the night,” the medik said. “Make sure he drinks something in the
morning and check his pupils. I had to give him a powerful sleeping draft.”
As the men moved off in the opposite direction, Kaz gestured his group
forward. The door in the rock was solid iron, broken only by a narrow slot
through which to pass the prisoner’s meals. Kaz bent to the lock.
Nina eyed the crude iron door. “This place is barbaric.”
“Most of the better fighters sleep in the old tower,” Kaz replied. “Keeps
them away from the rest of the population.”
Nina glanced left and right to where bright light spilled from the arena
entryways. There were guards standing in those doorways, distracted
maybe, but all one needed to do was turn his head. If they were caught here,
would the guards bother giving them over to the stadwatch for trial or
would they simply force them into the ring to be eaten by a tiger? Maybe
something less dignified, she thought bleakly. A swarm of angry voles.
It took Kaz a few quick heartbeats to pick the lock. The door creaked
open and they slipped inside.
The cell was pitch-black. A brief moment passed, and the cold green
glow of a bonelight flickered to life beside her. Inej held the little glass
sphere aloft. The substance inside was made from the dried and crushed
bodies of luminous deep-sea fishes. They were common among crooks in
the Barrel who didn’t want to get caught in a dark alley, but couldn’t be
bothered to lug around lanterns.
At least it’s clean, Nina thought, as her eyes adjusted to the gloom.
Barren and icy cold, but not filthy. She saw a pallet of horse blankets and
two buckets placed against the wall, one with a bloody cloth peeking over
the rim.
This was what the men of Hellgate competed for: a private cell, a
blanket, clean water, a bucket for waste.
Matthias slept with his back to the wall. Even in the dim illumination of
the bonelight, she could see his face was starting to swell. Some kind of
ointment had been smeared over his wounds—calendula. She recognized
the smell.
Nina moved toward him, but Kaz stopped her with a hand on her arm.
“Let Inej assess the damage.”
“I can—” Nina began.
“I need you to work on Muzzen.”
Inej tossed Kaz the crow-headed cane she must have been hiding
beneath her Gray Imp costume, and knelt over Matthias’ body with the
bonelight. Muzzen stepped forward. He removed his cloak and shirt and the
Madman’s mask. His head was shaved, and he wore prison-issue trousers.
Nina looked at Matthias then back to Muzzen, grasping what Kaz had in
mind. The two boys were about the same height and the same build, but that
was where the similarities ended.
“You can’t possibly mean for Muzzen to take Matthias’ place.”
“He isn’t here for his sparkling conversation,” Kaz replied. “You’ll need
to reproduce Helvar’s injuries. Inej, what’s the inventory?”
“Bruised knuckles, chipped tooth, two broken ribs,” Inej said. “Third
and fourth on the left.”
“His left or your left?” Kaz asked.
“His left.”
“This isn’t going to work,” Nina said in frustration. “I can match the
damage to Helvar’s body, but I’m not a good enough Tailor to make
Muzzen look like him.”
“Just trust me, Nina.”
“I wouldn’t trust you to tie my shoes without stealing the laces, Kaz.”
She peered at Muzzen’s face. “Even if I swell him up, he’ll never pass.”
“Tonight, Matthias Helvar—or rather, our dear Muzzen—is going to
appear to contract firepox, the lupine strain, carried by wolves and dogs
alike. Tomorrow morning, when his guards discover him so covered in
pustules that he is unrecognizable, he will be quarantined for a month to see
if he survives the fever and to outwait the contagion. Meanwhile Matthias
will be with us. Get it?”
“You want me to make Muzzen look like he has firepox?”
“Yes, and do it quickly, Nina, because in about ten minutes, things are
going to get very hectic around here.”
Nina stared at him. What was Kaz planning? “No matter what I do to
him, it won’t last a month. I can’t give him a permanent fever.”
“My contact in the infirmary will make sure he stays sick enough. We
just need to get him through diagnosis. Now get to work.”
Nina looked Muzzen up and down. “This is going to hurt just as much
as if you’d been in the fight yourself,” she warned.
He scrunched up his face, bracing for the pain. “I can take it.”
She rolled her eyes, then lifted her hands, concentrating. With a sharp
slice of her right hand over her left, she snapped Muzzen’s ribs.
He let out a grunt and doubled over.
“That’s a good boy,” said Kaz. “Taking it like a champion. Knuckles
next, then face.”
Nina spread bruises and cuts over Muzzen’s knuckles and arms,
matching the wounds to Inej’s descriptions.
“I’ve never seen firepox up close,” Nina said. She was only familiar
with illustrations from books they’d used in their anatomy training at the
Little Palace.
“Count yourself lucky,” Kaz said grimly. “Hurry it up.”
She worked from memory, swelling and cracking the skin on Muzzen’s
face and chest, raising blisters until the swelling and pustules were so bad
that he was truly unrecognizable. The big man moaned.
“Why would you agree to do this?” Nina murmured.
The swollen flesh of Muzzen’s face quivered, and Nina thought he
might be trying to smile. “Money was good,” he said thickly.
She sighed. Why else did anyone do anything in the Barrel? “Good
enough to get locked up in Hellgate?”
Kaz tapped his cane on the cell floor. “Stop making trouble, Nina. If
Helvar cooperates, he and Muzzen will both have their freedom just as soon
as the job is done.”
“And if he doesn’t?”
“Then Helvar gets locked back in his cell, and Muzzen still gets paid.
And I’ll take him to breakfast at the Kooperom.”
“Can I have waffles?” Muzzen mumbled.
“We’ll all have waffles. And whiskey. If this job doesn’t come off, no
one’s going to want to be around me sober. Finished, Nina?”
Nina nodded, and Inej took her place to bandage Muzzen to look like
Matthias.
“All right,” said Kaz. “Get Helvar on his feet.”
Nina crouched beside Matthias as Kaz stood over her with the bonelight.
Even in sleep, Matthias’ features were troubled, his pale brows furrowed.
She let her hands travel over the bruised line of his jaw, resisting the urge to
linger there.
“Not the face, Nina. I need him mobile, not pretty. Heal him fast and
only enough to get him walking for now. I don’t want him spry enough to
vex us.”
Nina lowered the blanket and went to work. Just another body, she told
herself. She was always getting late-night calls from Kaz to heal wounded
members of the Dregs who he didn’t want to bring around to any legitimate
medik—girls with stabbing punctures, boys with broken legs or bullets
lodged inside them, victims of a scuffle with the stadwatch or another gang.
Pretend it’s Muzzen, she told herself. Or Big Bolliger or some other fool.
You don’t know this boy. And it was true. The boy she knew might have
been the scaffold, but something new had been built upon it.
She touched his shoulder gently. “Helvar,” she said. He didn’t stir.
“Matthias.”
A lump rose in her throat, and she felt the ache of tears threatening. She
pressed a kiss to his temple. She knew that Kaz and the others were
watching and that she was making an idiot of herself, but after so long he
was finally here, in front of her, and so very broken. “Matthias,” she
repeated.
“Nina?” His voice was raw but as lovely as she remembered.
“Oh, Saints, Matthias,” she whispered. “Please wake up.”
His eyes opened, groggily, palest blue. “Nina,” he said softly. His
knuckles brushed her cheek; his rough hand cupped her face tentatively,
disbelievingly. “Nina?”
Her eyes filled with tears. “Shhhh, Matthias. We’re here to get you out.”
Before she could blink he had hold of her shoulders and had pinned her
to the ground.
“Nina,” he growled.
Then his hands closed over her throat.
