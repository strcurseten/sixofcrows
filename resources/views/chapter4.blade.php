<h3 style="text-align:center">Inej</h3>
Inej knew the moment Kaz entered the Slat. His presence reverberated
through the cramped rooms and crooked hallways as every thug, thief,
dealer, con man, and steerer came a little more awake. Per Haskell’s favored
lieutenant was home.
    The Slat wasn’t much, just another house in the worst part of the Barrel,
three stories stacked tight on top of each other, crowned with an attic and a
gabled roof. Most of the buildings in this part of the city had been built
without foundations, many on swampy land where the canals were
haphazardly dug. They leaned against each other like tipsy friends gathered
at a bar, tilting at drowsy angles. Inej had visited plenty of them on errands
for the Dregs, and they weren’t much better on the inside—cold and damp,
plaster sliding from the walls, gaps in the windows wide enough to let in the
rain and snow. But Kaz had spent his own money to have the Slat’s drafts
shorn up and its walls insulated. It was ugly, crooked, and crowded, but the
Slat was gloriously dry.
    Inej’s room was on the third floor, a skinny slice of space barely big
enough for a cot and a trunk, but with a window that looked out over the
peaked roofs and jumbled chimneys of the Barrel. When the wind came
through and cleared away the haze of coal smoke that hung over the city,
she could even make out a blue pocket of harbor.
    Though dawn was just a few hours away, the Slat was wide awake. The
only time the house was ever really quiet was in the slow hours of the
afternoon, and tonight everyone was buzzing with the news of the
showdown at the Exchange, Big Bolliger’s fate, and now poor Rojakke’s
dismissal.
    Inej had gone straight from her conversation with Kaz to seek out the
card dealer at the Crow Club. He’d been at the tables dealing Three Man
Bramble for Jesper and a couple of Ravkan tourists. When he’d finished the
hand, Inej had suggested they speak in one of the private gaming parlors to
spare him the embarrassment of being fired in front of his friends, but
Rojakke wasn’t having it.
    “It’s not fair,” he’d bellowed when she’d told him Kaz’s orders. “I ain’t
no cheat!”
    “Take it up with Kaz,” Inej had replied quietly.
    “And keep your voice down,” Jesper added, glancing at the tourists and
sailors seated at the neighboring tables. Fights were common in the Barrel,
but not on the floor of the Crow Club. If you had a gripe, you settled it
outside, where you didn’t risk interrupting the hallowed practice of
separating pigeons from their money.
    “Where’s Brekker?” growled Rojakke.
    “I don’t know.”
    “You always know everything about everything,” Rojakke sneered,
leaning in, the stink of lager and onions on his breath. “Isn’t that what
Dirtyhands pays you for?”
    “I don’t know where he is or when he’s getting back. But I do know you
won’t want to be here when he does.”
    “Give me my check. I’m owed for my last shift.”
    “Brekker doesn’t owe you anything.”
    “He can’t even face me? Sends a little girl to give me the boot? Maybe
I’ll just shake a few coins out of you.” He’d reached out to grab her by the
collar of her shirt, but she’d dodged him easily. He fumbled for her again.
    Out of the corner of her eye, Inej saw Jesper rise from his seat, but she
waved him off and slipped her fingers into the brass knuckles she kept in
her right hip pocket. She gave Rojakke a swift crack across the left cheek.
    His hand flew up to his face. “Hey,” he said. “I didn’t hurt you none. It
was just words.”
    People were watching now, so she hit him again. Regardless of the Crow
Club rules, this took precedence. When Kaz had brought her to the Slat,
he’d warned her that he wouldn’t be able to watch out for her, that she’d
have to fend for herself, and she had. It would have been easy enough to
turn away when they called her names or sidled up to ask for a cuddle, but
do that and soon it was a hand up your blouse or a try at you against a wall.
So she’d let no insult or innuendo slide. She’d always struck first and struck
hard. Sometimes she even cut them up a bit. It was fatiguing, but nothing
was sacred to the Kerch except trade, so she’d gone out of her way to make
the risk much higher than the reward when it came to disrespecting her.
Rojakke touched his fingers to the ugly bruise forming on his cheek,
looking surprised and a bit betrayed. “I thought we was friendly,” he
protested.
The sad part was that they were. Inej liked Rojakke. But right now, he
was just a frightened man looking to feel bigger than someone.
“Rojakke,” she’d said. “I’ve seen you work a deck of cards. You can get
a job in almost any den. Go home and be grateful Kaz doesn’t take what
you owe him out of your hide, hmmm?”
He’d gone, a bit wobbly on his feet, still clutching his cheek like a
stunned toddler, and Jesper had sauntered over.
“He’s right, you know. Kaz shouldn’t send you to do his dirty work.”
“It’s all dirty work.”
“But we do it just the same,” he said with a sigh.
“You look exhausted. Will you sleep at all tonight?”
Jesper just winked. “Not while the cards are hot. Stay and play a bit.
Kaz will stake you.”
“Really, Jesper?” she’d said, pulling up her hood. “If I want to watch
men dig holes to fall into, I’ll find myself a cemetery.”
“Come on, Inej,” he’d called after her as she passed through the big
double doors onto the street. “You’re good luck!”
Saints, she’d thought, if he believes that, he really must be desperate.
She’d left her luck behind in a Suli camp on the shores of West Ravka. She
doubted she’d see either again.
Now Inej left her tiny chamber in the Slat and headed downstairs by
way of the banisters. There was no reason to cloak her movements here, but
silence was a habit, and the stairs tended to squeak like mating mice. When
she reached the second-floor landing and saw the crowd milling below, she
hung back.
Kaz had been gone longer than anyone had expected, and as soon as
he’d entered the shadowy foyer, he’d been waylaid by people looking to
congratulate him on his routing of Geels and asking for news of the Black
Tips.
“Rumor has it Geels is already putting together a mob to move on us,”
said Anika.
“Let him!” rumbled Dirix. “I’ve got an axe handle with his name on it.”
“Geels won’t act for a while,” said Kaz as he moved down the hall. “He
doesn’t have the numbers to face us in the streets, and his coffers are too
empty to hire on more hands. Shouldn’t you be on your way to the Crow
Club?”
The raised eyebrow was enough to send Anika scurrying away, Dirix on
her heels. Others came to offer congratulations or make threats against the
Black Tips. No one went so far as to pat Kaz on the back, though—that was
a good way to lose a hand.
Inej knew Kaz would stop to speak to Per Haskell, so instead of
descending the final flight of stairs, she moved down the hallway. There
was a closet here, full of odds and ends, old chairs with broken backs, paint 
spattered canvas sheeting. Inej moved aside a bucket full of cleaning
supplies that she’d placed there precisely because she knew no one in the
Slat would ever touch it. The grate beneath it offered a perfect view of Per
Haskell’s office. She felt slightly guilty for eavesdropping on Kaz, but he
was the one who had turned her into a spy. You couldn’t train a falcon, then
expect it not to hunt.
Through the grate she heard Kaz’s knock on Per Haskell’s door and the
sound of his greeting.
“Back and still breathing?” the old man inquired. She could just see him
seated in his favorite chair, fiddling with a model ship he’d been building
for the better part of a year, a pint of lager within arm’s reach, as always.
“We won’t have a problem with Fifth Harbor again.”
Haskell grunted and returned to his model ship. “Close the door.”
Inej heard it shut, muffling the sounds from the hallway. She could see
the top of Kaz’s head. His dark hair was damp. It must have started raining.
“You should have gotten permission from me to deal with Bolliger,”
said Haskell.
“If I had talked to you first, word might have gotten out—”
“You think I’d let that happen?”
Kaz’s shoulders lifted. “This place is like anything in Ketterdam. It
leaks.” Inej could have sworn he looked directly at the vent when he said it.
“I don’t like it, boy. Big Bolliger was my soldier, not yours.”
“Of course,” Kaz said, but they both knew it was a lie. Haskell’s Dregs
were old guard, con men and crooks from another time. Bolliger had been
one of Kaz’s crew—new blood, young and unafraid. Maybe too unafraid.
“You’re smart, Brekker, but you need to learn patience.”
“Yes, sir.”
The old man barked a laugh. “Yes, sir. No, sir,” he mocked. “I know
you’re up to something when you start getting polite. Just what have you
got brewing?”
“A job,” Kaz said. “I may need to be gone for a spell.”
“Big money?”
“Very.”
“Big risk?”
“That, too. But you’ll get your twenty percent.”
“You don’t make any major moves without my say-so, understood?”
Kaz must have nodded because Per Haskell leaned back in his chair and
took a sip of lager. “Are we to be very rich?”
“Rich as Saints in crowns of gold.”
The old man snorted. “Long as I don’t have to live like one.”
“I’ll talk to Pim,” Kaz said. “He can pick up the slack while I’m gone.”
Inej frowned. Just where was Kaz going? He hadn’t mentioned any big job
to her. And why Pim? The thought shamed her a bit. She could almost hear
her father’s voice: So eager to be Queen of the Thieves, Inej? It was one
thing to do her job and do it well. It was quite another to want to succeed at
it. She didn’t want a permanent place with the Dregs. She wanted to pay off
her debts and be free of Ketterdam forever, so why should she care if Kaz
chose Pim to run the gang in his absence? Because I’m smarter than Pim.
Because Kaz trusts me more. But maybe he didn’t trust the crew to follow a
girl like her, only two years out of the brothels, not even seventeen years
old. She wore her sleeves long and the sheath of her knife mostly hid the
scar on the inside of her left forearm where the Menagerie tattoo had once
been, but they all knew it was there.
Kaz exited Haskell’s room, and Inej left her perch to wait for him as he
limped his way up the stairs.
“Rojakke?” he asked as he passed her and started up the second flight.
“Gone,” she said, falling in behind him.
“He put up much of a fight?”
“Nothing I couldn’t handle.”
“Not what I asked.”
“He was angry. He may come back around looking for trouble.”
“Never a shortage of that to hand out,” Kaz said as they reached the top
floor. The attic rooms had been converted into his office and bedroom. She
knew all those flights of stairs were brutal on his bad leg, but he seemed to
like having the whole floor to himself.
He entered the office and without looking back at her said, “Shut the
door.”
The room was mostly taken up by a makeshift desk—an old warehouse
door atop stacked fruit crates—piled high with papers. Some of the floor
bosses had started using adding machines, clanking things crowded with
stiff brass buttons and spools of paper, but Kaz did the Crow Club tallies in
his head. He kept books, but only for the sake of the old man and so that he
had something to point to when he called someone out for cheating or when
he was looking for new investors.
That was one of the big changes Kaz had brought to the gang. He’d
given ordinary shopkeepers and legitimate businessmen the chance to buy
shares in the Crow Club. At first they’d been skeptical, sure it was some
kind of swindle, but he’d brought them in with tiny stakes and managed to
gather enough capital to purchase the dilapidated old building, spruce it up,
and get it running. It had paid back big for those early investors. Or so the
story went. Inej could never be sure which stories about Kaz were true and
which were rumors he’d planted to serve his own ends. For all she knew,
he’d conned some poor honest trader out of his life savings to make the
Crow Club thrive.
“I’ve got a job for you,” Kaz said as he flipped through the previous
day’s figures. Each sheet would go into his memory with barely a glance.
“What would you say to four million kruge?”
“Money like that is more curse than gift.”
“My little Suli idealist. All you need is a full belly and an open road?”
he said, the mockery clear in his voice.
“And an easy heart, Kaz.” That was the difficult part.
Now he laughed outright as he walked through the door to his tiny
bedroom. “No hopes of that. I’d rather have the cash. Do you want the
money or not?”
“You’re not in the business of giving gifts. What’s the job?”
“An impossible job, near certain death, terrible odds, but should we
scrape it…” He paused, fingers on the buttons of his waistcoat, his look
distant, almost dreamy. It was rare that she heard such excitement in his
raspy voice.
“Should we scrape it?” she prompted.
He grinned at her, his smile sudden and jarring as a thunderclap, his eyes
the near-black of bitter coffee. “We’ll be kings and queens, Inej. Kings and
queens.”
“Hmm,” she said noncommittally, pretending to examine one of her
knives, determined to ignore that grin. Kaz was not a giddy boy smiling and
making future plans with her. He was a dangerous player who was always
working an angle. Always, she reminded herself firmly. Inej kept her eyes
averted, shuffling a stack of papers into a pile on the desk as Kaz stripped
out of his vest and shirt. She wasn’t sure if she was flattered or insulted that
he didn’t seem to give a second thought to her presence.
“How long will we be gone?” she asked, darting a glance at him through
the open doorway. He was corded muscle, scars, but only two tattoos—the
Dregs’ crow and cup on his forearm and, above it, a black R on his bicep.
She’d never asked him what it meant.
It was his hands that drew her attention as he shucked off his leather
gloves and dipped a cloth in the washbasin. He only ever removed them in
these chambers, and as far as she knew, only in front of her. Whatever
affliction he might be hiding, she could see no sign of it, only slender
lockpick’s fingers, and a shiny rope of scar tissue from some long ago street
fight.
“A few weeks, maybe a month,” he said as he ran the wet cloth under
his arms and the hard planes of his chest, water trickling down his torso.
For Saints’ sake, Inej thought as her cheeks heated. She’d lost most of
her modesty during her time with the Menagerie, but really, there were
limits. What would Kaz say if she suddenly stripped down and started
washing herself in front of him? He’d probably tell me not to drip on the
desk, she thought with a scowl.
“A month?” she said. “Are you sure you should be leaving with the
Black Tips so riled up?”
“This is the right gamble. Speaking of which, round up Jesper and
Muzzen. I want them here by dawn. And I’ll need Wylan waiting at the
Crow Club tomorrow night.”
“Wylan? If this is for a big job—”
“Just do it.”
Inej crossed her arms. One minute he made her blush and the next he
made her want to commit murder. “Are you going to explain any of this?”
“When we all meet.” He shrugged on a fresh shirt, then hesitated as he
fastened the collar. “This isn’t an assignment, Inej. It’s a job for you to take
or leave as you see fit.”
An alarm bell rang inside her. She endangered herself every day on the
streets of the Barrel. She’d murdered for the Dregs, stolen, brought down
bad men and good, and Kaz had never hinted that any of the assignments
were less than a command to be obeyed. This was the price she’d agreed to
when Per Haskell had purchased her contract and liberated her from the
Menagerie. So what was different about this job?
Kaz finished with his buttons, pulled on a charcoal waistcoat, and tossed
her something. It flashed in the air, and she caught it with one hand. When
she opened her fist, she saw a massive ruby tie pin circled by golden laurel
leaves.
“Fence it,” Kaz said.
“Whose is it?”
“Ours now.”
“Whose was it?”
Kaz stayed quiet. He picked up his coat, using a brush to clean the dried
mud from it. “Someone who should have thought better before he had me
jumped.”
“Jumped?”
“You heard me.”
“Someone got the drop on you?”
He looked at her and nodded once. Unease snaked through her and
twisted into an anxious, rustling coil. No one got the better of Kaz. He was
the toughest, scariest thing walking the alleys of the Barrel. She relied on it.
So did he.
“It won’t happen again,” he promised.
Kaz pulled on a clean pair of gloves, snapped up his walking stick, and
headed out the door. “I’ll be back in a few hours. Move the DeKappel we
lifted from Van Eck’s house to the vault. I think it’s rolled up under my bed.
Oh, and put in an order for a new hat.”
“Please.”
Kaz heaved a sigh as he braced himself for three painful flights of stairs.
He looked over his shoulder and said, “Please, my darling Inej, treasure of
my heart, won’t you do me the honor of acquiring me a new hat?”
Inej cast a meaningful glance at his cane. “Have a long trip down,” she
said, then leapt onto the banister, sliding from one flight to the next, slick as
butter in a pan
